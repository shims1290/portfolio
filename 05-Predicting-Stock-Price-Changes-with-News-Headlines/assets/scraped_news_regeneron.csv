2012-1-12,CORRECTED-Regeneron posts \'11 Eylea sales of $24-25 mln,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN1E80B05920120112,"* Eylea 2011 sales totaled $24-25 mln* Regeneron estimates 2012 U.S. sales of $140-$160 mlnSAN FRANCISCO, Jan 9 (Reuters) - Sales of Eylea, the eye drug launched last November by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc , totaled between $24 million and $25 million through the end of last year, the company said on Monday.The unaudited results blew past the average Wall Street estimate of $5 million, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.“The adoption has been really quite spectacular,” Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Leonard Schleifer told Reuters in an interview here at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference.He estimated 2012 Eylea sales of between $140 million and $160 million.Eylea, approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of a common cause of blindness in the elderly, is in direct competition with Lucentis, a well-established drug sold by Roche .Schleifer attributed the strong Eylea launch to the fact that Regeneron listened to doctors and patients when developing Eylea, which can be given once every two months, compared with the typical monthly dosing of Lucentis.At launch, Eylea was priced at $1,850 per dose, $100 less than Lucentis. According to Roche’s Genentech unit, the average cost for one year of Lucentis treatment in the U.S. depends on the number of injections a patient receives and typically ranges from $9,750 to $15,600.“Patients and doctors are looking for alternatives,” Schleifer said, noting that it was still too early to tell if patients are being switched from Lucentis to Eylea.Both Eylea and Lucentis also face competition from Roche’s cancer drug Avastin, which costs only around $50 per dose and is often used by doctors to treat macular degeneration even though it has not been approved by the FDA for that purpose.Regeneron has full marketing rights to Eylea in the United States and would share overseas profits equally with Germany’s Bayer ."
2012-1-13,Analysis: Investors likely to wait out 2012 drug launches,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE80C1SQ20120113,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Burned by disappointing early sales for new, high-profile biotech medicines in 2011, healthcare investors are cautious ahead of this year’s expected crop of drug launches.Not so long ago, biotech makers could practically bank on seeing their company values jump once they obtained regulatory approval to market a drug. Now, investors are more likely to wait on the sidelines, or short a stock, ahead of proof the new treatments will be a commercial success, a process that could take months.“People are all freaked out about product launches,” said ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum.Well aware of that angst, drug developers are spending far more time laying the groundwork to get paid by insurance plans and to convince doctors and patient groups of their medicines’ value as they prepare for regulatory approval.""There was a time when products got full value prior to launch. I think we have now swung back in the other direction,"" said John Orwin, chief executive officer at Affymax Inc AFFX.O, which expects U.S. regulators to decide by late March whether to approve its experimental anemia drug.Shares of Dendreon Corp DNDN.O, maker of the novel therapeutic prostate cancer vaccine Provenge, ended last year down 83 percent from their peak in May, while Human Genome Sciences HGSI.O finished with a drop of 75 percent after launching Benlysta, the first new drug for lupus in more than 50 years.Initial sales of Provenge and Benlysta failed to live up to lofty expectations, and investors are cautious ahead of early sales results for drugs launched in 2011 by companies including Incyte Corp INCY.O, Seattle Genetics SGEN.O and Savient Pharmaceuticals SVNT.O.Even shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX.O, which launched hepatitis C drug Incivek last year with record-breaking sales of $420 million for its first full quarter on the market, ended the year 44 percent below their 52-week high.The overall sector is up so far this year, and still outperforms the wider stock market. The Nasdaq Biotech Index .NBI rose 12 percent in 2011, compared with a flat return for the Standard & Poor's 500 Index .SPX.The growing challenges for new drugs -- reimbursement, regulatory issues and safety concerns -- were major topics here this week at the annual JP Morgan healthcare conference. ""Sometimes there is a gap between customers' expectations and companies' expectations,"" said Yoshihiko Hatanaka, CEO of Astellas Pharma 4503.T, Japan's No. 2 drugmaker. ""It is critical for us to reduce that gap.""Astellas has partnered with Medivation Inc MDVN.O to develop prostate cancer drug MDV3100, which could win regulatory approval as soon as late 2012.As the market has begun to recognize that innovative drugs have unproven real-world outcomes, companies are pursuing more niche markets.“There is a trend away from big launches,” said Ulrik Schulze, global leader for biopharma R&D at Boston Consulting Group.In the 1990s, it typically took less than two years for a new pharmaceutical to reach peak sales, he said. That time frame is widening as companies grapple with pressure from payers and a greater focus on whether a new treatment truly improves upon existing ones.Some drugmakers are even starting to compete on the basis of price at a drug’s launch, rather than expect a premium for its novelty.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O, which began selling its macular degeneration drug Eylea in November, said this week that sales in the first six weeks totaled $24 million to $25 million -- well above the $5 million expected by Wall Street.Eylea competes against Roche AG's ROG.VX well-established Lucentis, but is priced slightly lower on a per-dose basis and can be given less frequently.CEO Leonard Schleifer said Regeneron was careful ahead of its launch to lay the groundwork with retinal physicians and to set up a system for reimbursement.“If you deliver a product that physicians, payers, and patients think is an important product, your launch will be fine,” he said.Affymax also plans to undercut the price of its biggest rival for the treatment of anemia in kidney dialysis patients -- Amgen Inc's AMGN.O blockbuster Epogen.“We recognize that peginesatide has to be part of a solution to lower costs,” Orwin said, referring to the Affymax drug.Amgen CEO-elect Robert Bradway said the company expects competition from Affymax sometime this year, but still anticipates less erosion in Epogen sales relative to 2011. Sales of Epogen, which totaled $2.5 billion in 2010, have waned over the last several years amid safety concerns.Amgen expects the Food and Drug Administration to decide in late April whether to approve its bone drug Xgeva, or denosumab, for preventing the spread of prostate cancer to the bone.“Xgeva is the biggest opportunity for us in 2012,” Bradway said.But uptake of denosumab for osteoporosis has been gradual and some Wall Street analysts are wary of Xgeva’s potential relevance in the prevention of bone cancer.The first high-profile drug that could reach the market this year is diabetes treatment Bydureon, which is being developed by Amylin Pharmaceuticals AMLN.O after it recently ended a long-time diabetes partnership with Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N.The latest deadline for an FDA decision on Bydureon is January 28.Bydureon faces strong competition from similar drugs and Amylin will for the first time be responsible for launching a drug on its own.“We think there is substantial uncertainty and think that there is somewhat more risk of sales falling short than of exceeding our estimates,” Cowen and Co said in a research note to clients."
2012-1-27,Infinity stops cancer drug trial,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE80Q0VH20120127,"(Reuters) - Infinity Pharmaceuticals pulled the plug on a mid-stage trial of its experimental pancreatic cancer drug as it failed to show benefit over a placebo, wiping off over 41 percent of its market value.Data from a preliminary analysis showed that patients receiving placebo along with an anti-cancer chemotherapy drug lived longer than patients who received the Infinity drug saridegib in combination with chemotherapy.“It was a risky program to begin with and metastatic pancreatic cancer is an extremely tricky indication and I can only count failures in the past,” said ThinkEquity analyst Mani Mohindru.Pancreatic cancer has proven to be a tough nut to crack for even major drugmakers. In 2009, Pfizer ended its late-stage trial of axitinib, followed soon after by Sanofi-Aventis and Regeneron’s decision to drop their late-stage trial of aflibercept for the same indication.World-wide more than 266,000 people die of pancreatic cancer every year, which to date has been treated with standard chemotherapy gemcitabine.“I am surprised (by the trial result), given the data they released last week from their Phase 1 trial,” Mohindru said.“There was nothing to suggest that the combination of gemcitabine and saridegib was bad.”Infinity said it stopped the current trial because the drug, which it is developing in partnership with privately held Purdue Pharma and its affiliate Mundipharma, would not meet its main goal.The mid-stage trial was testing 122 patients with previously untreated, metastatic pancreatic cancer.“I don’t think the drug is dead, but I certainly think that there is no reason to continue to pursue in pancreatic cancer,” Rodman & Renshaw analyst Michael King said.Infinity is testing saridegib in mid-stage trials as a single agent therapy in myelofibrosis, a rare bone marrow disorder, and a life-threatening cancer of the cartilage.“We continue to believe in the therapeutic potential of Hedgehog pathway inhibition,” the company said.The Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company expects to report data from the myelofibrosis mid-stage trial in the second half of 2012.However, both analysts have not assigned any value to these two indications while calculating their price targets.Infinity shares are worth about $5 based on the cash and value of other programs, King said.The company is also developing another drug, retaspimycin hydrochloride, for non-small cell lung cancer. The drug is in mid-stage trial.The stock was down 40 percent at $5.99 -- its lowest in four months -- in morning trade on Friday on the Nasdaq. The stock, which had touched a low of $5.85 earlier in the session, was the top percentage loser on the exchange. About 859,000 shares changed hands by 1615 GMT, more than 14 times their normal volume."
2012-10-16,Roche sees more cancer success as sales top forecast,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE89F07T20121016,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG is banking on a new generation of breast cancer medicines to drive sales growth after strong demand for its established cancer treatments helped it to top forecasts in the third quarter.Most of Roche’s best-selling cancer drugs do not face imminent generic competition, sparing it the pain from a wave of patent expiries currently sweeping the global drugs industry.It is further buttressing its defenses by developing follow-on drugs which can be used in combination with its existing medicines, helping to extend the longevity of its expensive brand name drugs.On a conference call for journalists, Chief Executive Severin Schwan declined to comment on speculation Roche would reconsider its dropped $6.8 billion bid to buy U.S. gene-sequencing company Illumina. But he added Roche was looking at ways to expand in sequencing “both internally and externally.”Third-quarter sales rose 15 percent to 11.27 billion Swiss francs ($12.1 billion), beating the average analyst forecast of 11.12 billion francs in a Reuters poll.This figure was helped by the weakening of the Swiss franc against the dollar and the yen in the quarter.“Third quarter results are once again a strong set of numbers. (The) company continues to grow, while the rest of the industry is fighting against patent expirations and pricing pressures,” said Vontobel analyst Andrew Weiss, who has a ‘buy’ rating on the stock.Roche shares, which have beaten the European healthcare sector by gaining 15.5 percent this year, traded up 0.4 percent to 184.7 francs at 0755 GMT, in line with the index.Roche said it had high hopes for newly-launched drug Perjeta, a treatment for women with a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer which was approved by U.S. regulators in June and is a follow on to its third biggest seller Herceptin.It said there was broad willingness among doctors in the United States to prescribe Perjeta. Sales of the drug, which many analysts tip as a future blockbuster - which would mean selling over $1 billion a year - were 26 million francs so far.The Basel-based company is also hoping to gain European and U.S. approval for a new chemotherapy-carrying “armed” antibody called T-DM1, a drug for advanced breast cancer.Roche, which kicks off the third-quarter reporting season for major drugmakers, kept its guidance for sales to grow by a low-to-mid single digit percentage at constant exchange rates this year, with core earnings up in the high single-digits.In the third quarter group sales grew 4 percent at constant exchange rates.Sales at the dominant pharmaceutical business surpassed forecasts, driven by solid growth in its top three cancer medicines - MabThera, Avastin and Herceptin - and a 27 percent leap in rheumatoid arthritis medicine Actemra in the quarter.This helped offset declines in eye drug Lucentis due to competition from Regeneron’s drug Eylea, and lower sales of CellCept, a medicine given to organ transplantation patients.In Roche’s diagnostics division, strong growth in its professional and tissue diagnostics units helped offset a decline in its diabetes business, which suffered from ongoing price pressures and reimbursement cuts.($1 = 0.9341 Swiss francs)"
2012-10-24,"Regeneron profit boosted by Eylea, raises drug\'s forecast again",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE89N0UT20121024,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc reported third-quarter earnings that blew past Wall Street expectations on strong growth in its eye drug Eylea, whose sales projections the company raised for the fourth time this year.The biotechnology company now expects full-year Eylea sales of between $790 million and $815 million in the United States, above the $700 million to $750 million it forecast in late-July, and nearly five times the initial forecast it made in January.Shares of the New York-based company were up 5 percent in trading before the bell, after closing at $152.99 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.“With the recent approval of Eylea for (an additional use) and the anticipated launch beginning by the end of this year in Japan, Australia, and Europe, we expect Eylea to continue to drive growth through 2013 and beyond,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said.Eylea was approved last November to treat wet age-related macular degeneration of the eye, or damage to the macula - the central region of the retina. Wet age-related macular degeneration is the leading cause of blindness among the elderly.The drug was also approved in late-September to treat thickening of the macula that may follow a central retinal vein occlusion, or a blockage in the veins that carry blood away from the eye.Regeneron will receive about half of the profit from Eylea sales outside the United States, where the drug is being marketed by Germany’s Bayer Ag.Eylea could also benefit from the recent meningitis outbreak in the United States that may reduce off-label usage of Roche Holding AG’s cancer drug Avastin, which along with the Swiss drugmaker’s Lucentis, competes with the Regeneron drug.Avastin is one of the drugs compounded at the New England Compounding Center (NECC), the Boston-area pharmacy whose steroid shot were linked to several meningitis deaths.BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough said in a note on Monday that the perceived risk of using compounded Avastin and the increase in regulatory scrutiny could limit the drug’s bulk distribution.Third-quarter Eylea sales rose about 26 percent over the previous quarter to $244 million.Regeneron’s total revenue rose more than four-fold to $427.7 million from a year earlier.The company recorded a $50 million milestone payment from partner Sanofi SA related to the August approval of their colorectal cancer drug, Zaltrap. The drug recorded sales of $8 million in the third quarter.Analysts expected revenue of $349.2 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.The company reported a net profit of $191.5 million in the period, or $1.72 per share, compared with a loss of $62.4 million, or 68 cents per share, a year earlier.Analysts were expecting earnings of 95 cents per share."

2012-11-05,Experimental Pfizer cholesterol drug promising in study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8A41AY20121105,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - An experimental Pfizer Inc cholesterol drug showed promise in a small midstage trial, putting the world’s largest drugmaker in the race to develop a medicine from a promising new class, albeit behind similar programs by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Amgen Inc.The drug, RN316, which Pfizer acquired with its purchase of Rinat Neuroscience, is a PCSK9 inhibitor, a class of biotech medicines that has generated great excitement in the industry.The drugs work by blocking a protein that slows removal of bad LDL cholesterol from the blood and are considered potentially the most important advance in the field since widely used statin drugs, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor.In a 12-week trial of about 130 patients already on high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, Pfizer’s PCSK9 drug cut LDL cholesterol by 56 percent at the highest dose of 6 milligrams/kilogram of weight. The 3 mg/kg dose lowered LDL levels by 46 percent on top of statins, according to data unveiled on Monday.Barry Gumbiner, executive director of clinical research for Pfizer’s PCSK9 program, said the results were somewhat misleading because any patient whose LDL level fell below 25 had doses withheld as a precaution, skewing the overall results.After four weeks, patients on the highest dose had LDL reductions of up to 80 percent before some had doses withheld, Pfizer explained. The data was presented at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Los Angeles.PCSK9 drugs are intended for use by the millions of people who either cannot tolerate statins or cannot get their LDL levels down to target goals with statins and other drugs, including patients with a genetic condition that makes them predisposed to extreme, dangerously high cholesterol.Analysts have said the PCSK9 drugs could generate billions of dollars in annual sales.The Pfizer drug was administered intravenously once every four weeks for a total of three dosings in the brief proof-of-concept trial. Subsequent trials will use a version injected under the skin, with the next Phase II study designed to determine which doses of the drug will be advanced into much larger, late-stage studies, the company said.Patients on the higher doses who were not taken off the drug over the 12 weeks experienced sustained LDL level declines of 75 percent, said Gumbiner, who presented the data at the meeting.The drug was also tested at doses of 0.25 mg/kg and 1 mg/kg against a placebo.Pfizer researchers said the drug appeared to be well-tolerated, with no allergic reactions or safety issues of concern cropping up in the small study.Earlier on Monday, U.S. biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and its partner, French drugmaker Sanofi, announced plans to begin enrolling subjects in an 18,000-patient study to determine whether its PCSK9 drug can reduce heart attacks, strokes and death. That and an ambitious program that includes several smaller Phase III studies solidify Regeneron as the clear front-runner in the race to bring one of these new medicines to market.Amgen Inc, which is also aggressively pursuing a rival PCSK9 drug, is somewhat further along than Pfizer. The world’s largest biotech company presented data from two Phase II studies at the heart meeting on Monday and planned to present the results of two more midstage trials on Tuesday.Sean Harper, Amgen’s research chief, said in a telephone interview that the company expects to begin its Phase III trials early next year."
2012-11-05,Amgen experimental drug lowers cholesterol in mid-stage trial,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8A418B20121105,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s experimental drug AMG145 reduced levels of bad cholesterol by as much as 55 percent in combination with statin drugs in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, according to data from a midstage trial presented on Monday.The new drug, given by injection every four weeks, is part of a promising new class of biotech medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors designed to target a protein that prevents the body from removing artery blocking LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.Statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor, work by preventing the liver from making cholesterol.The Phase II trial found that after 12 weeks, patients treated with a low dose of AMG145 had a 43 percent reduction in LDL, while those given a higher dose had a drop of 55 percent. Patients treated with a placebo saw a 1 percent increase in LDL cholesterol.The trial, presented here at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association, included 168 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in which a defective gene inherited from one parent impairs the ability to properly metabolize LDL. The disorder is estimated to affect about one in 500 people and causes extremely high cholesterol.The most common side effects seen in the trial were injection-site reactions, cold-like symptoms and headache.AMG145, along with other PCSK9 inhibitors being developed by companies like Pfizer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi and Roche, is a man-made antibody."
2012-11-05,WRAPUP-New class of cholesterol drugs shows promise in trials,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1E8M5EC720121105,"LOS ANGELES, Nov 5 (Reuters) - A new class of experimental cholesterol-lowering drugs demonstrated a promising new technique for reducing levels of the artery-clogging fatty deposits in mid-stage studies.The medicines, which are man-made antibodies, lowered “bad” cholesterol by more than 40 percent and up to 80 percent in small Phase 2 studies released by Amgen Inc and Pfizer Inc on Monday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association in Los Angeles.The drugs, given by injection every two or four weeks, are part of a group of biotech medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors designed to target a protein that prevents the body from removing artery-blocking LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.The most commonly used cholesterol-lowering drugs - statins such as Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor - work by preventing the liver from making cholesterol.The expiration of patents on all but one of that top-selling class of heart medicines - Crestor - has eroded one of the main sources of drug company profits.Mean annual sales of 15 different categories of heart drugs are set to fall by more than a quarter by 2017, from $83 billion in 2011 to $60 billion, according to consensus analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Pharma.Analysts have said the PCSK9 drugs could generate billions of dollars in annual sales.The experimental drugs from Pfizer and Amgen proved effective in lowering LDL cholesterol by significant amounts in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol and in patients unable to tolerate statins, according to the mid-stage data.The drugmakers aim, however, is to also show the new drugs can lower the risk of heart disease in a much broader group of patients who are not able to control their cholesterol with statins and other drugs, such as Merck and Co’s Zetia.Partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals <REGN.O) and Sanofi announced on Monday the launch of an 18,000-patient trial of their once-every-two-weeks PCSK9 inhibitor to see if it cuts the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death, putting them ahead of the field pursuing the new class of drugs.Roche is also developing a PCSK9 drug.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt estimated that there are roughly 1 million U.S. patients who are intolerant to statins and another 11 million whose cholesterol is poorly controlled by the drugs.In a Phase 2 trial, Amgen’s drug AMG145 showed it can reduce LDL levels by as much as 55 percent when combined with statins in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol. After 12 weeks, patients treated with a low dose of AMG145 had a 43 percent reduction in LDL, while those given a higher dose had a drop of 55 percent. Patients treated with a placebo saw a 1 percent increase in LDL cholesterol.A second Phase 2 trial of AMG145 found that it reduced LDL by up to 51 percent in patients unable to tolerate statins. When those patients were treated with AMG145 and ezetimibe - the chemical name for Zetia, LDL fell by 63 percent.The trial results were generally in line with expectations, said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.Amgen will present more AMG145 trial results on Tuesday, including a mid-stage trial in patients with uncontrolled cholesterol despite statins, which Yee said will be more interesting data.Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen, told Reuters in a telephone interview that the company plans to launch pivotal-stage trials of the drug early next year.He said the company will conduct a broader Phase 3 trial designed to see whether AMG145 can lower the risk of heart problems, and it was “not unreasonable” to assume that such a trial would take five years to yield results.Pfizer, which slightly lags Amgen and Regeneron in development of its experimental PCSK9 inhibitor, presented mid-stage trial data showing that its drug, RN316, also significantly lowers LDL cholesterol levels.In a 12-week trial of about 130 patients already on high doses statins, the Pfizer drug cut LDL cholesterol by 56 percent at the highest dose of 6 milligrams/kilogram of weight. The 3 mg/kg dose lowered LDL levels by 46 percent on top of statins, according to data unveiled on Monday.Barry Gumbiner, executive director of clinical research for Pfizer’s PCSK9 program, said the results were somewhat misleading because any patient whose LDL level fell below 25 had doses withheld as a precaution, skewing the overall results.After four weeks, patients on the highest dose had LDL reductions of up to 80 percent before some had doses withheld, Pfizer explained.The Pfizer drug was administered intravenously once every four weeks for a total of three dosings in the brief proof-of-concept trial.

Harper said it was “not unreasonable” to assume that such a trial would take five years to yield results.“We have seen a very consistent effect of lowering LDL ... which is really important because by reducing LDL by half one would predict that we would be reducing the risk of cardiovascular events by about that same amount,” Harper said.Shares of Amgen, which have risen 37 percent so far this year, were up 88 cents at $87.23 in Nasdaq trading."

He noted that more work needs to be done to determine the drug’s full impact on the liver and on muscles.Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen, said the company plans to begin pivotal-stage trials of AMG145 early next year.He said the company plans to first file for regulatory approval of AMG145 based on Phase III studies looking at the drug’s ability to lower LDL.Amgen also plans to conduct a broader Phase III trial designed to see whether AMG145 can lower the risk of heart problems. Harper said it was “not unreasonable” to assume that such a trial would take five years to yield results.“We have seen a very consistent effect of lowering LDL ... which is really important because by reducing LDL by half one would predict that we would be reducing the risk of cardiovascular events by about that same amount,” Harper said.Shares of Amgen, which have risen 37 percent so far this year, were up 88 cents at $87.23 in Nasdaq trading.

2012-11-08,Novartis says may have 14 new blockbuster drugs by 2017,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8A70RH20121108,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis could produce 14 or more new big-selling ‘blockbuster’ drugs within five years as it bets on cancer, heart and respiratory treatments to fill the gaps left by expiries on current patents, the Swiss firm said on Thursday.Like many of its rivals, Novartis is facing headwinds as some of its top earners lose patent protection, particularly blood pressure drug Diovan. It is counting on its newest products, such as breast cancer drug Afinitor, to pump up sales.But some analysts caution that recently launched drugs like multiple sclerosis pill Gilenya and eye medicine Lucentis will face growing competition next year as Biogen Idec and Regeneron bring rival products to market.Novartis currently has 139 projects in clinical development including more than 73 new molecular entities spread across a wide area of diseases, it said in a statement published ahead of an investor event in Boston on Thursday.Among its most promising products are serelaxin and LCZ686 to treat patients with heart failure as well as drugs for psoriasis and multiple sclerosis. It plans to file serelaxin for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe in early 2013.However, the results of a late-stage study for serelaxin published on Tuesday were mixed and some analysts think Novartis may need further trials to guarantee its commercial success.Chief Executive Joseph Jimenez did not rule out further trials but said in a conference call with reporters it would press ahead with filings using the current data.Novartis’s shares were 1.3 percent higher at 57.30 francs by 1315 GMT, when the Stoxx 600 Europe healthcare sector index was up 0.2 percent.“Novartis does have a very productive research engine. However we will include significant value once we see convincing data,” said Andrew Weiss, an analyst at Vontobel.Novartis said its pharmaceuticals division aimed to file nine products for approval over the next 12 months. It expects the unit - which is responsible for more than half of sales - to return to growth from the second half of next year.Novartis was also confident about its oncology pipeline, which it expects to contribute more than $1 billion in sales by 2017, while it said recently launched Afinitor could have sales of $2 billion in advanced breast cancer by 2017.It is also hoping to convince doctors that they should switch patients onto Tasigna when one of its best-selling drugs Glivec loses patent exclusivity in 2015.Novartis plans to initiate further trials in 2013 to prove that patients with chronic myeloid leukemia who have taken Tasigna may be able to stop treatment once their cancer is under control.The company also said it planned to manage more projects but keep a lid on costs by cutting recruitment time and spending on trials. Measures include giving handheld devices to doctors to record trial data and to get pharmacy chains to undertake some of the simpler trial work."
2012-11-16,Sanofi gets boost as EU backs diabetes and cancer drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8AF0QD20121116,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sanofi won the backing of European regulators for two new drugs against diabetes and cancer on Friday, a shot in the arm for the French company’s drive to bring new products to market.New diabetes drug Lyxumia was recommended for treating type 2 diabetes and Zaltrap was endorsed for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) said.Recommendations from the EMA are normally endorsed by the European Commission within two or three months and Sanofi said it expected to hear from the Commission in the first quarter of 2013.Lyxumia, which Sanofi licensed from Denmark’s Zealand Pharma, is part of a new class of diabetes treatments called GLP-1 analogues which prompt the body to release insulin when a diabetic’s blood sugar level climbs too high.It is one of several new medicines Sanofi is banking on to drive growth after patent losses on former top-selling drugs.Pierre Chancel, Sanofi’s global head of diabetes, said the positive opinion for Lyxumia was “an important milestone” and would help expand the company’s already strong diabetes franchise, which is dominated by the long-acting insulin Lantus.Sanofi plans to submit Lyxumia for approval with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of the year.Rival GLP-1 treatments include Novo Nordisk’s Victoza, and Byetta and Bydureon, from Amylin, the U.S. drugmaker acquired earlier this year by Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.Zaltrap, developed with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is a so-called anti-angiogenic agent, designed to starve tumors of blood. It was approved in the United States in August.Although the drug failed to live up to its promise as a treatment for prostate cancer in late-stage tests, it has shown significant improvement in overall survival in patients with colon cancer.Shares in Sanofi were 0.6 percent by 1340 GMT. The stock is up close to a fifth this year, making it France’s largest company by market capitalization, reflecting growing confidence that new drugs will help it offset patent losses on older ones."
2012-12-02,Analysis: Drugmakers step up search for hearing loss medicines,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8B102H20121202,"ZURICH/LONDON (Reuters) - When Swiss biotech firm Auris Medical wanted to recruit patients to test its experimental hearing loss drug, it decided to enlist partygoers deafened by firecrackers on New Year’s Eve.In the weeks leading up to December 31, 2005 it advertised in the subway and on radio stations in Munich and Berlin, urging victims of sudden firecracker-induced hearing loss to turn up at designated clinics for treatment on January 1.“We had just one single day of enrolment, we didn’t know how many people would show up,” Thomas Meyer, managing director of Auris, told Reuters.Luckily, his gamble paid off and the small private company is now one of the leaders in what has been an empty space for the pharmaceutical industry.Auris managed to recruit enough people to show that its compound AM-111 posed no safety risk and has since successfully completed a mid-stage trial in acute sensorineural hearing loss, or sudden deafness, involving 210 patients.While there is no guarantee that its drug, which is injected through the eardrum, will pass muster in final-stage tests, the progress by Auris and a clutch of rival biotech firms is making large pharmaceutical companies sit up and take notice.There are currently no approved disease-modifying drugs for hearing loss, which affects nearly a third of people aged 65 to 74 and half of those over 75.But the science is developing and investor interest is growing, piqued by the huge commercial success of recent new treatments for sight loss, such as Lucentis from Novartis and Roche and Eylea from Regeneron and Bayer.British charity Action on Hearing Loss conservatively puts the potential Western market for new drugs at $4.6 billion a year - a figure that could grow quickly as ageing populations swell the ranks of those with hearing problems.“It’s one of the few areas that, as yet, hasn’t really been tackled by the drugs industry,” said Kate Bingham, managing partner at SV Life Sciences Advisers, a venture capital firm with investments in new drugs for both eyes and ears.Bingham sits on the board of Autifony Therapeutics - a hearing loss firm spun out of GlaxoSmithKline in which the British drugmaker retains a stake.Historically, hearing loss has received little attention from Big Pharma, given the lack of obvious targets for drug intervention, the difficulties of running clinical trials and a widespread belief that most deafness could not be reversed.Now the big companies are getting involved, although the work is early-stage.“A drug that is therapeutic and priced right could be quite a blockbuster. That’s why they’ve put their toe in the water,” said Jonathan Kil, chief medical officer at Seattle-based Sound Pharmaceuticals, which is enrolling young iPod users in a trial of an oral drug for noise-induced hearing loss.U.S. giant Pfizer is arguably the most advanced of the big players, with a drug in initial Phase I clinical testing trial for age-related sensorineural hearing loss that looks to enhance the function of existing hair cells.Some of its biggest rivals are laying bets, too. Last year French drugmaker Sanofi inked a two-year research deal with privately held Dutch biotech firm Audion Therapeutics to develop small molecule drugs to improve hearing.In October, Roche joined forces with venture capital firm Versant Ventures and biotech Inception Sciences to find molecules targeting ear hair cell protection and regeneration in the cochlea, the spiral-shaped cavity in the inner ear.Cross-town competitor Novartis, meanwhile, struck a 2010 deal potentially worth more than $213 million with U.S. biotech GenVec to develop gene-based treatments to replace hair cells in the ear that transmit sound.“We’re looking at restoration as our main line of work and we’re interested in whether there are chemicals that might also play this role instead of having to introduce a gene,” said Novartis research head Mark Fishman.“This is an area that’s a bit more futuristic and ultimately restoring the hair cells will be the cure.”Unlike new eye drugs, which work by inhibiting an unwanted process, hearing drugs will need to restore damaged function - a more difficult proposition.Experts say the first drugs will target niche areas, such as damage caused by loud noise or as a result of chemotherapy.“Hearing loss is not just one condition. It’s like cancer - there are lots of different types and there is work to be done to segment the market,” said Ralph Holme, head of biomedical research at Action on Hearing Loss.Heading the field for noise-induced hearing loss is South Illinois University, which has launched a late-stage trial with the U.S. military for an drug to increase protection for people exposed to very noisy environments like soldiers.Canada’s Adherex also has a late-stage trial to test a drug that may protect against hearing loss caused by platinum-based anti-cancer agents in children.While protective treatments could become available within the next few years, regenerative approaches - such as injecting stem cells into the ear or chemically intervening to switch on genes that control cell growth - are much further off.Despite recent promising tests in gerbils, the potential to replicate this in humans is still uncertain, said Pascal Senn, an ear specialist at the University of Berne.“If something grows inside the ear, you must be sure that it doesn’t grow excessively or form tumors. There are a lot of roadblocks that need to be overcome in this field. It’s highly risky, but I think it’s also the hottest area,” he said.One intriguing possibility for the future is the convergence of future drugs and devices. Hearing aid manufacturers have certainly not been deaf to the noises from the pharma sector.Sonova, the world’s largest maker of hearing aids, has invested in two start-up companies - one in the United States for drugs to protect hearing and another Swiss biotech working on a treatment for acute tinnitus.It bought U.S. cochlear implant manufacturer Advanced Bionics in 2009 in a bid to increase its focus on the inner ear and understand how drug treatments could work with implants.“It will be interesting whether the innovation will be driven by pharma companies moving in or whether the hearing aid companies will branch out,” said Auris’ Meyer."
2012-12-13,More pressure to justify cost of cancer drugs versus benefits,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8BC1GH20121213,"(Reuters) - Medical providers have begun to think more about cost, as well as safety and effectiveness, when they decide on cancer treatments.In the past, pharmaceutical companies could launch a high-priced drug with little push back. But now, there is more pressure from insurers as well as doctors to justify using drugs that provide only incremental benefits. Products that offer clear-cut advances in treatment, however, still command premium prices.The pressure on costs is likely to accelerate. The U.S. Affordable Care Act includes several provisions aimed at improving the value of healthcare, including paying hospitals for the quality of care rather than the quantity.“It’s a sign of the times,” said Mark Mynhier, partner, healthcare industries advisory at PricewaterhouseCoopers PwC. “We are in fact in a significantly financially challenging environment.”Four-fifths of U.S. health insurers recently polled by PwC now require evidence of cost savings or a clear clinical benefit to include new products on their lists of covered drugs.Doctors at New York’s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center decided in November not to use Zaltrap, a new $11,000 a month colon cancer drug, because it has a “modest” impact on survival, works no better than Avastin, a similar but cheaper competitor, and has worse side effects.Sanofi SA, according to the hospital, responded by offering the drug to all health providers at a 50 percent discount to its wholesale price.The Manhattan cancer center still does not include Zaltrap on its list of available drugs. Sanofi and Regeneron, which helped develop and also sells the drug, both declined to comment.“In order to warrant the price, you are going to have to have better overall survival,” said Rhonda Greenapple, chief executive at Reimbursement Intelligence, a consulting firm specializing in medical reimbursement.Linking value to patient outcomes - mainly a drug’s impact on survival - is particularly important in oncology, where treatment costs can total tens of thousands of dollars a year.“In cases where there are co-pays, they really do effect the consumer,” Mynhier said. “Patients are saying ‘I can’t afford to pay 10 or 20 percent of a $100,000 therapy.’”WellPoint Inc, the second-largest U.S. health insurer by market value, said it is increasing the amount it pays for less expensive generic cancer drugs as an incentive for doctors to use them.Infused cancer medications are first purchased by doctors, who then bill insurers for reimbursement. That is different from pills and other oral drugs for which doctors typically write a prescription filled at a pharmacy.The offer of a 50-percent discount to Zaltrap’s list price is a potential windfall for doctors. Patients, health insurers, the government or anyone else who pays healthcare bills would not see a benefit.“At the very least it is an incentive for doctors to use the drug,” said Dr Leonard Saltz, chief of Memorial Sloan-Kettering’s gastrointestinal oncology service. “And I find that concerning.”He noted that rebates and discounts for cancer drugs are not uncommon, but said this is the first time he is aware of a verbal across-the-board offer for a half-price discount.The average U.S. oncologist, according to the Journal of Oncology Practice, generated revenue of nearly $5 million last year, of which drug costs accounted for nearly $3 million.To combat the temptation of wider profit margins, health plans in recent years began reimbursing doctors for cancer drugs based on average sales prices, rather than wholesale prices. But for a new drug such as Zaltrap, reimbursement is based on the full list price until a sales track record is established.WellPoint said it is raising reimbursements to independent oncologist on a range of generic chemotherapy drugs by as much as 140 percent.“These drugs are the backbone of many therapies recommended by the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) ... and typically much less expensive than their brand counterparts,” said Jennifer Malin, WellPoint’s medical director oncology.She said the goal is to shift the system away from what has been a largely drug-revenue based practice model, to one where oncologists are paid for providing good patient-centered care.“The payers are looking at the quality data and demanding incremental value over existing products,” said Dan Mendelson, chief executive officer of consulting firm Avalere Health.“COKE DIDN’T WORK, SO LET’S TRY PEPSI”Zaltrap was approved in August by the Food and Drug Administration after a study found it improved survival, in combination with chemotherapy, by 1.4 months in colon cancer patients who had stopped responding to chemo.That is the same benefit seen with Avastin, sold by Roche Holding AG for around $5,000 a month, or about half the price of Zaltrap.NCCN guidelines say either one or the other drug should be used, not both, but Dr Saltz said most Zaltrap use is likely in patients who were already treated with Avastin - a practice that insurers will eventually stop.“It’s like saying Coke didn’t work so let’s try Pepsi,” he said.As scientists unravel the biological underpinnings of cancer cells, new targeted therapies are being developed, but the process is expensive.Dr. Saltz said the solution might just be to walk away from drugs with small, incremental benefits.“We simply can’t afford to pay these very, very large amounts for drugs that offer most people very small benefit,” Dr Saltz said. “We haven’t figured out how to rein it in.”"

A deal in Greece was expected, setbacks and delays notwithstanding, and the lack of a substantial pullback in that time has some analysts viewing equities as extended.“That the deal was approved really reduces a lot of the tension over the euro zone, but it was expected and on a short-term basis we’re very done to the upside,” said Yu-Dee Chang, chief trader of ACE Investments in McLean, Virginia.“That’s why we’re went up and then backed off this morning.

2012-2-13,"Regeneron raises 2012 Eylea sales forecast, shares jump",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE81C0UR20120213,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O significantly raised its 2012 sales forecast for its key eye drug Eylea, suggesting fast adoption of the recently approved drug, sending its shares to a lifetime high.The company, which has a market capitalization of about $10 billion, now expects Eylea net sales of $250 million to $300 million in the United States in 2012.It had earlier forecast net sales of $140 million to $160 million for the drug, which received U.S. regulatory approval in November to treat a common cause of blindness in the elderly.The raise in sales outlook is a potential signal of strong demand, J.P. Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham said, but added that “questions remain about the specifics of this demand for Eylea.”“The 2012 guidance was initially provided about one month ago at the J.P. Morgan healthcare conference, so it is not clear what has materially changed demand-wise since then.”Fourth-quarter sales for Eylea, which competes with Roche Holding's ROG.VX Lucentis, were $24.8 million.The drug’s advantage over Roche’s drug is that it can be given once every two months, compared with the typical monthly dosage of Lucentis -- a benefit that, analysts say, gives Eylea an edge.When launched, Eylea, which is approved to treat wet macular degeneration -- the most serious form of the disease -- was also priced below Lucentis.Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, with the wet form being the most serious. About 11 million Americans have signs of AMD.However, both Eylea and Lucentis face competition from Roche’s cancer treatment Avastin. Avastin costs only around $50 per dose and is often used by doctors to treat macular degeneration even though it is not approved for that purpose.Leerink Swann analyst Joshua Schimmer said the company will see greater investor appreciation in 2012 as patients switching from Lucentis or Avastin do well on Eylea, and these patients are also the ones who require the most frequent injections.He added that sales estimates for the drug may be revised further, as “conservative assumptions for 2012 may improve as physicians gain comfort with the reimbursement process, which sound to be going smoothly.”Schimmer raised his 2012 U.S. sales estimate for the drug to$299 million from $195 million.Separately, the company said in a regulatory filing that it sent a letter to the U.S. health regulator reporting incidents of inflammation following the use of Eylea injection.Regeneron said excluding a cluster of events occurring at a single practice, the overall rate of the adverse events was about 0.01 percent following the administration of the drug.Leerink’s Schimmer said the rate of adverse events is consistent with other similar therapies for AMD.Eylea was developed in collaboration with Germany's Bayer AG BAYGn.DE. Regeneron is also developing a cancer compound known as Zaltrap with French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA.The company’s shares, which have more than doubled in value since Eylea’s approval, were up 13 percent at $115.22 in morning trade on the Nasdaq. They touched a life high of $116.48 earlier in the session."
2012-3-09,FDA asks experts if pain drugs get second chance,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8280N120120309,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators are asking experts for advice on whether companies should restart clinical trials for painkillers that help people with osteoarthritis and other conditions, but can destroy joints.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said these drugs, from the class of anti-nerve growth factors, represent a potentially significant and novel strategy for the treatment of pain,” in a memo posted online on Thursday.However, the FDA put a hold on almost all clinical trials of the drugs in 2010 after nearly 500 people taking the drugs in studies had to have their joints replaced.Companies were allowed to keep testing the drugs in terminal cancer patients who had severe pain in their bones, since the benefits there may outweigh risks.Pfizer Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Johnson & Johnson are now pitching to resume wider trials, in what could be a multi-billion-dollar pain market.Outside advisers to the FDA will vote on Monday on whether there is a way for trials to move forward, perhaps by limiting the drugs to lower doses, or to only certain conditions where people have fewer treatment options.The drugs have been studied for common conditions like low back pain and osteoarthritis, or damage to the joints caused by wear and tear. The condition affects about 27 million adults in the United States and is a common cause of chronic disability.The drugs have also been tested in narrower groups, like people with bladder pain syndrome.The drugs block a protein called nerve growth factor (NGF) that is associated with nerve pain. However, NGF may also help with wound repair and the growth of new blood vessels, the FDA said.The joint problems with the drug may be because it blocks these beneficial effects of the growth protein, one FDA reviewer said.Pfizer was furthest along in development of its biotech anti-NGF drug, tanezumab, when the FDA asked it to halt trials in June 2010 because of the joint problems. Pfizer had already reported positive data for the medicine.We’ve had strong results from the clinical program. That’s why we’re so interested in progressing these compounds forward,” Pfizer said in an interview on the advisory meeting. They have the promise of offering chronic pain patients something they haven’t had in the past.”Before the trials were halted, analysts had projected peak global sales for tanezumab above $1 billion a year.The anti-NGF drugs have the potential to become the first biotechnology drugs specifically for pain.Several injectable biotechnology medicines are used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, a potentially crippling immune system disorder. More traditional oral pain killers, such as aspirin, ibuprofen and Pfizer’s own Celebrex, are typically used to treat osteoarthritis, but may have side effects such as promoting bleeding."
2012-3-12,FDA panel says pain drug trials should continue,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE82B1DG20120312,"(Reuters) - A panel of advisers on Monday voted unanimously that companies such as Pfizer Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc should be allowed to continue testing a type of painkiller that helps people but can destroy joints.The advisers to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration voted 21-0 that the agency should lift its hold on clinical trials of the drugs, from the class of anti-nerve growth factors.The FDA is not required to follow panel recommendations, though it often does, and will make a final decision later.The FDA halted almost all clinical trials of the drugs in 2010 after nearly 500 people taking the drugs in studies had to have joints replaced.Pfizer, Regeneron, and Johnson & Johnson are now pitching to resume wider trials, in what could be a multi-billion-dollar pain market.The FDA advisers said the drugs provide a meaningful benefit to help people treat pain, many of whom may not have other options. They said companies should try to figure out which patients would benefit most, and perhaps try to exclude those who may be predisposed to joint problems.“I think we can’t close the door ... for this class of drugs because it is unique, and it has been shown to be effective,” said Susan Broyles, the patient representative on the panel.Companies have studied the drugs for common conditions like low back pain and osteoarthritis, or damage to the joints caused by wear and tear. The condition affects about 27 million adults in the United States and is a common cause of chronic disability.The drugs have also been tested in narrower groups, like people with bladder pain syndrome.The drugs work by blocking a protein called nerve growth factor that is associated with nerve pain.

Pfizer had already reported positive data for the medicine.“Physicians and patients are in need of options for difficult-to-treat pain conditions and the panel’s vote today is an important step towards helping us more fully understand the benefit-risk profile of this important new class of medicines,” said Steve Romano, a senior vice president at Pfizer.Before the trials were halted, analysts had projected peak global sales for tanezumab above $1 billion a year."
2012-3-13,Regeneron says eye drug capturing Roche patients,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE82C1DF20120313,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said surveys suggest its Eylea treatment for macular degeneration is capturing 60 percent of its sales from patients that have abandoned Roche Holding AG’s Lucentis and Avastin medicines.Regeneron CEO Leonard Schleifer said on Tuesday Eylea has pronounced advantages over Lucentis - Roche’s older treatment for the leading cause of blindness among the elderly - including a 45 percent lower annual cost and the need for roughly only half as many injections into the eye.Regeneron shares have more than doubled since Eylea was approved by U.S. regulators on November 18 for the dangerous “wet” form of macular degeneration. More than 200,000 cases of the sight-robbing condition are diagnosed in the United States each year.The Regeneron drug only needs to be administered every other month, after being injected monthly for the first three months. Lucentis - which, like Eylea, works by blocking a protein called VEGF - was approved in 2006 for injections once a month.Lucentis costs about $2,000 per dose, slightly more than a dose of Eylea. But many macular degeneration patients instead take specially formulated injections of a Roche cancer drug called Avastin that costs only about $50 and is not approved to treat macular degeneration.A study last year showed Avastin, which is chemically similar to Lucentis, was as effective as the more costly Roche drug for the eye condition. But Schleifer, speaking at the Barclays Capital Global Healthcare Conference, said surveys suggest a large group of patients have switched from Lucentis and Avastin to Eylea.“Initial uptake continues to exceed expectations,” he said, referring to overall U.S. sales of Eylea, with surveys suggesting 60 percent coming from former Lucentis and Avastin users and the remaining 40 percent from patients taking anti-VEGF drugs for the first time.Last month, Regeneron significantly boosted its 2012 U.S. sales forecast for Eylea to between $250 million and $300 million. The news sent its stock to nearly a lifetime high of $115.Some industry analysts expect Regeneron shares to reach $135 or $140 within a year, as sales of Eylea continue to outpace industry expectations."

2012-3-21,Next big cholesterol drugs in focus at meeting,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE82K1BS20120321,"NEW YORK/CHICAGO (Reuters) - A possible revolutionary way to fight cholesterol is expected to cause a big stir among thousands of heart doctors gathering in Chicago starting this weekend for the annual American College of Cardiology meeting.The new drugs in development by top pharmaceutical makers and up-and-coming biotechs are injectable medications that block a protein called PCSK9.They have shown promise in early clinical trials for slashing “bad” LDL cholesterol further than widely used statins can alone. Their biggest advocates say PCSK9 blockers have the potential to be the next multibillion-dollar class of heart drugs.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc last year disclosed that its product slashed levels of LDL cholesterol up to 65 percent beyond reductions seen alone with statins - pills like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor that are today’s standard treatments.The company on Monday will unveil full trial results, including safety findings - giving a fuller picture of its potential and how widely it might be prescribed if approved.Wall Street has followed the drug, called REGN 727, as well as rival products from Amgen Inc, Merck & Co and other drugmakers that are nipping at its heels. But relatively few doctors know much about the emerging new class of treatments.“I can’t believe the cardiologists won’t be in awe of the LDL reductions” seen for Regeneron’s drug, said Mani Mohindru, an analyst with Think Equity. She speculated the medicine, being developed in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi, could generate huge sales if it succeeds in larger trials and remains free of serious safety concerns.Regeneron is best known for its drug Eylea, approved to treat a leading cause of blindness called macular degeneration. Company shares have more than doubled to the $115 range since the injectable medicine, which competes with Roche Holding AG’s Lucentis, was approved by U.S. regulators in November.Mohindru said Regeneron shares could jump another $5 or more, to new lifetime highs, after the REGN 727 study is presented on Monday in Chicago.“It will be a significant event because a lot of cardiologists haven’t seen this data,” she said. “And Wall Street still doesn’t appreciate how wide a use the drug could have. It’s not in Regeneron’s stock in a big way, so there’s upside here.”Amgen on Sunday will present data from a study of its anti-PCSK9 medicine, called AMG145. Although it is an early-stage trial involving relatively few patients, compelling effectiveness and safety data might allow it to steal some of the Regeneron product’s thunder.“PCSK9 is one of the most exciting targets in cardiovascular drug development today,” Michael Severino, Amgen’s chief medical officer, said in an interview.Severino said a large number of patients - some studies suggest 40 to 50 percent - fail to reach their cholesterol-lowering goals despite being on statins, and that PCSK9 inhibitors could give them the needed extra push. Moreover, the drugs could help a much smaller group of patients who cannot tolerate statins, he said.An estimated 9 million Americans are deemed at high or very high risk of heart-related problems, and could benefit most from PCSK9 drugs added to statins. And at least another 1 million could use them instead of statins.“For 30 years there really hasn’t been another drug therapy of important magnitude added to the benefit of statins,” said Dr. Jefferey Borer, head of cardiology for SUNY-Downstate Medical Center in New York. “Most doctors don’t know about this approach, so I think there will be a tremendous amount of interest at the meeting and people will begin to talk about it.”But Borer cautioned that more safety data is needed for anti-PCSK9 drugs because so many people may use them. “We need many large trials.”Regeneron plans to begin a number of large late-stage trials of REGN 727 by mid-2012. Amgen, meanwhile, is gearing up for a series of mid-stage studies of its product that will involve almost 2,000 patients.“The initial market opportunity might be the sickest patients, maybe those who have had a heart attack or are at risk of another heart attack,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas, who added that segment represents about 3 million people in the United States.“Nobody knows their sales potential,” she said, but speculated the class of drugs could fetch $8 billion to $25 billion a year, depending on pricing and how widely they are prescribed.Hundreds of other studies will be presented at the four-day heart meeting that begins on Saturday, tracing the effectiveness of medicines, medical devices and medical procedures. Researchers will present findings on when it is most beneficial to use a coronary computed tomography angiogram on people who come to the emergency room with chest pain, and a study that examines the benefits of lowering LDL cholesterol earlier in life. Researchers will also present two-year data on Edwards Lifesciences Corp’s aortic heart valve that can be implanted using a catheter, rather than through traditional open heart surgery. Data from the first year of the study was the highlight of last year’s meeting, showing the device was effective but greatly increased the risk of stroke. Another study likely to draw interest from cardiologists and endocrinologists alike is a trial that compared blood sugar, cholesterol, blood pressure and other measures of obese patients who underwent two types of bariatric surgery with those whose blood sugar was managed with drugs."

The findings will better enable investors to size up the pros and cons of the rival therapies.Neither drug has so far shown any serious side effects in clinical trials.Dias said the ability of drugs like AMG 145 to slash LDL beyond decreases attributed to statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor could help enable millions of heart patients to finally get their cholesterol levels tightly controlled.“A good 60 percent of high-risk patients in the United States are unable to meet their aggressive goals of getting LDL levels down” to target levels, Dias said, making them prime candidates for AMG 145 if it continues to do well in trials and is approved.Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, said anti-PCSK9 drugs, when used with statins, could eventually have a profound impact.“If these drugs come to market, just about everyone with high cholesterol will be able to get to goal,” Nissen said, with the possible exception of “several hundred” people with rare genetic conditions that would not benefit.Industry analysts says PCSK9 inhibitors, if approved, could generate annual sales approaching $20 billion.Nissen cautioned, however, that larger trials are needed to assess the safety of AMG 145 and REGN 727. He said a big question that remains is whether U.S. regulators would approve the drugs without first requiring major studies that evaluate long-term heart attack and stroke risk.“That’s the subtle wrinkle here,” said Nissen, who speculated the U.S. Food and Drug Administration might be willing to approve them without such costly outcomes trials because statins were approved without them on the basis of their ability to lower cholesterol.Nissen said statins and the PCSK9 inhibitors, although different classes of medicines, both exert their influence on the LDL receptor - a protein that carries LDL cholesterol through the bloodstream.“So one could argue that PCSK9 uses the same pathway as statins,” he said, a consideration that might score points with the FDA.A four-week dosing schedule might be “modestly more attractive” to patients and doctors than injections every two weeks, Nissen said.“But the frequency is not a make or break consideration,” he added, because patients would be able to inject themselves with the same types of tiny needles that are already widely used and accepted for other conditions, including diabetes."
2012-3-25,Monthly shots of Amgen drug slash cholesterol up to 66 pct,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2E8EP2BP20120325,"* Strong reductions seen with 2-week, 4-week shots* Side effects similar to placebo in trialCHICAGO, March 25 (Reuters) - Monthly injections of an experimental drug from Amgen Inc slashed levels of cholesterol by up to an additional 66 percent in patients already taking statins, researchers said on Sunday, making it a potential strong rival to a similar drug being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.Amgen and Regeneron are racing to develop medicines that cut cholesterol through a new strategy, by blocking a protein called PCSK9.In earlier studies, both drugs cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by up to two thirds, although Amgen’s AMG 145 had been tested in healthy volunteers taking no other cholesterol medicines, while Regeneron’s REGN 727 was tested in patients with high cholesterol that also took statins.Amgen on Sunday reported its first results from an early-stage trial of AMG 145 in patients with high cholesterol also taking statins, and impressive findings were seen in those getting injections every two weeks or every month.In the 51-patient study, patients receiving monthly injections of AMG 145 and taking low to moderate doses of statins had up to a two-thirds reduction in LDL cholesterol by the eighth week of the study.“We gave two doses four weeks apart and at the eighth week there was minimal tapering off” of the drug’s potency, Clapton Dias, Amgen’s medical services director, said in an interview. “The 66-percent reduction of LDL was maintained.”In patients receiving injections of AMG 145 every two weeks in combination with low to moderate doses of statins, LDL reductions of up to 75 percent were seen after six weeks, Amgen said.Those taking the Amgen drug every two weeks in combination with high doses of statins had LDL reductions of up to 63 percent.Data from the Phase 1 study were presented at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology being held in Chicago.Researchers on Monday are slated to release the full data from a Phase II study of REGN 727, which Regeneron is developing in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi. The findings will better enable investors to size up the pros and cons of the rival therapies.Neither drug has so far shown any serious side effects in clinical trials.Dias said the ability of drugs like AMG 145 to slash LDL beyond decreases attributed to statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor could help enable millions of heart patients to finally get their cholesterol levels tightly controlled.“A good 60 percent of high-risk patients in the United States are unable to meet their aggressive goals of getting LDL levels down” to target levels, Dias said, making them prime candidates for AMG 145 if it continues to do well in trials and is approved.Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic, said anti-PCSK9 drugs, when used with statins, could eventually have a profound impact.“If these drugs come to market, just about everyone with high cholesterol will be able to get to goal,” Nissen said, with the possible exception of “several hundred” people with rare genetic conditions that would not benefit.Industry analysts says PCSK9 inhibitors, if approved, could generate annual sales approaching $20 billion.Nissen cautioned, however, that larger trials are needed to assess the safety of AMG 145 and REGN 727.

2012-3-26,Regeneron cholesterol drug faces sudden challenge,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE82P0R020120326,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A new type of drug being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc slashed levels of cholesterol almost in half when given every four weeks, but fell short of reductions reported a day earlier with once-monthly injections of Amgen Inc’s rival product.Both monoclonal antibodies work by blocking a protein called PCSK9, and are shaping up to be the next big thing in preventing heart attack and stroke. Wall Street expects the new class of drugs, including those in earlier stages of development at Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, to generate annual future sales of up to $20 billion.Regeneron is developing its entry, called REGN 727, in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi. The product, which has completed mid-stage trials and is heading toward far larger Phase III studies, has been considered to be the clear front runner.Amgen’s drug, AMG 145, is just entering mid-stage studies and is considered about a year behind REGN 727 in development. Although it is far less-known than the Regeneron antibody, stellar results from a Phase I trial of the Amgen product raised its profile considerably when reported on Sunday at the annual sessions of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago.In the 51-patient study, patients receiving monthly injections of AMG 145 and taking low to moderate doses of statins had up to a 66 percent reduction in “bad” LDL cholesterol by the eighth week of the study.“We gave two doses, four weeks apart, and at the eighth week there was minimal tapering off” of the drug’s potency, Clapton Dias, Amgen’s medical services director, told Reuters.By contrast, data presented Monday at the Chicago heart meeting showed that the effect of REGN 727 in a mid-stage trial, when given at high doses every four weeks, tapered off unacceptably.“The cholesterol lowering was consistent at two weeks, but at four weeks you could see effectiveness of the drug begin to wane,” its lead researcher, James McKenney, said in an interview.“LDL began to come back up,” said McKenney, who is chief executive officer of Richmond, Virginia-based testing company National Clinical Research. He speculated that future late-stage trials of REGN 727 will therefore likely be built around two-week dosing.Given every two weeks, the Regeneron drug cut LDL levels up to 72 percent, McKenney said. That is roughly in line with maximum reductions of 75 percent seen with AMG 145. No serious side effects have been reported for either medicine.The conventional wisdom in the pharmaceutical industry is that drugs given infrequently -- once a day instead of twice daily, or monthly as opposed to biweekly -- have a decided commercial advantage because of their greater convenience to patients. It applies especially to injectable drugs.Steven Nissen, head cardiologist at the Cleveland Clinic, on Sunday said those assumptions are breaking down as more injectable biotech medicines come to market.He said he did not believe less-frequent dosing would render a big advantage to either of the two companies.A four-week dosing schedule may be “modestly more attractive” to patients and doctors than injections every two weeks, Nissen said in an interview at the heart conference. “But the frequency is not a make-or-break consideration,” he added, because patients would be able to inject themselves with the same types of tiny needles that are already widely used and accepted for other conditions, including diabetes.Although it did not pan out for monthly dosing, McKenney said REGN 727 had “remarkable” and persistent potency when patients received injections every two weeks along with one of three available daily doses of Pfizer Inc’s statin Lipitor.Those receiving 50 milligram doses of Lipitor achieved an additional 40 percent reduction in LDL cholesterol, beyond that seen with patients taking Lipitor alone. He said 64 percent and 72 percent reductions in LDL were seen among patients who received, respectively, 100 milligram or 150 milligram daily doses of Lipitor.“Forty percent, 64 percent, 72 percent reductions. I’m saying, ‘Wow!’ -- I’ve never seen anything like this,” McKenney said, recalling his excitement when data from the Regeneron-sponsored trial became unblinded. “In three decades of doing clinical research in the cardiovascular field, this is the most impressive drug I’ve ever seen, so I have great hope this could be a breakthrough.”McKenney said REGN 727 and Lipitor, when taken together virtually guarantee that patients will achieve their cholesterol-lowering goals.“You’ve taken it to the limit. You can’t lower LDL cholesterol any more than bringing these drugs together.”But a growing number of drugmakers, including Amgen, can be expected in coming years to challenge McKenney’s thesis."

The FDA is due to give a decision by August 4.Priority review is granted to a drug if preliminary estimates show it has the potential to provide a treatment where no adequate therapy exists or a significant improvement compared with marketed products, Sanofi said.“Sanofi and Regeneron are committed to the continued development of Zaltrap,” Sanofi oncology head Debasish Roychowdhury said in the statement."
2012-4-26,Regeneron nearly doubles Eylea sales forecast,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE83P0VS20120426,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O nearly doubled its 2012 sales forecast for recently approved Eylea, the second time it has done so this year, as the eye drug rapidly gained share from competing products.The news sent the New York-based company’s shares up 14 percent to $145.05 -- their highest ever -- on Thursday morning on the Nasdaq.Regeneron now expects sales of $500 million to $550 million from the drug this year, up from the $250 million to $300 million range it forecast in February.“Investors were expecting an increase in 2012 Eylea guidance to the $400 million range,” Cowen and Co analyst Phil Nadeau said in a note to clients.Eylea was approved in November to treat a form of macular degeneration, a common cause of blindness in the elderly, and now contributes more than half of Regeneron’s revenue.The company said last month that surveys suggested Eylea was capturing 60 percent of its sales from patients who have abandoned Roche Holding AG's ROG.VX Lucentis and Avastin medicines.Eylea’s advantages over Lucentis include a 45 percent lower annual cost and the need for roughly only half as many injections into the eye.The company has full marketing rights to the drug in the United States and would share overseas profits equally with Bayer AG BAYGn.DE if Eylea wins regulatory approval in other countries.Regeneron reported a first-quarter net income of $11.6 million, or 11 cents per share, compared with a loss of $43.4 million, or 49 cents per share, a year ago.Quarterly revenue rose 52 percent to $232 million, well ahead of analysts’ expectations of $173.1 million."

2012-5-04,FDA staff question side effects of Regeneron gout drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8430QM20120504,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug reviewers said Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s drug to prevent gout flares worked, but questioned its side effects and whether it did enough to help patients.The Food and Drug Administration staff on Friday said the injectable drug, called Arcalyst, was meant to be used for only 16 weeks to prevent gout flares - the first treatment for the condition with such a limited timeline.Shares of Regeneron, the maker of eye drug Eylea, fell 2.4 percent to $130.75 in morning trading on Nasdaq, underperforming the broader market.The FDA staff review comes ahead of an advisory panel of outside experts, which will vote on whether to recommend the drug next Tuesday. The FDA will make a final decision by July 30, taking into account the panel’s recommendations.Regeneron’s drug, known generically as rilonacept, is already approved to treat a group of rare genetic auto-inflammatory diseases. But the small biotech company is hoping to expand its use to prevent gout flares in people starting uric acid-lowering therapy.Gout is a painful condition that occurs when the bodily waste product, uric acid, is deposited in the joints and soft tissues. It affects about 5 million to 6 million Americans.While there are already treatments for gout flares in general, none exist specifically for people who are starting therapy to lower their uric acid, and none is meant to be used for only 16 weeks, the FDA staff said.“From an efficacy standpoint, it will be important to address whether 16 weeks provide for an adequate duration for flare prophylaxis during initiation of (uric acid-lowering therapy),” the staff said, according to documents posted online on Friday.The FDA staff also said Regeneron’s drug, which is an injectable biologic, suppresses the immune system, which could increase the number of cancerous cells. Six people treated with Arcalyst during clinical trials developed malignancies, or cancerous cells that could spread, compared to zero for those taking a dummy drug during the trials.However, the FDA staff said the treatment duration of 16 weeks was relatively short, making it less likely the drug caused tumors - though the imbalance between Arcalyst and placebo still raised concerns."
2012-5-08,FDA advisers rebuff Regeneron gout drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE84719920120508,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug advisers unanimously voted against Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental drug to prevent gout flares, based on studies that tested the drug for only 16 weeks.A panel of outside experts to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday voted 11-0 against approving the injectable drug, called Arcalyst, because its clinical trials were too short to prove the treatment was safe, or that it would help patients over time.Gout is a painful condition that occurs when the bodily waste product, uric acid, is deposited in the joints and soft tissues, causing inflammation and sometimes making it difficult to walk. It affects about 5 million to 6 million Americans.“A lot of the patients where we envision using this drug are going to take it for longer than 16 weeks. It’s hard for me to allow patients to be exposed (without longer safety data),” said panel member Dr. David Blumenthal, an assistant professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine.The FDA usually follows panel recommendations, although it is not required to, and will make a final decision on the drug by July 30.Regeneron’s drug, known generically as rilonacept, is already approved to treat a group of rare genetic auto-inflammatory diseases. But the company is hoping to expand its use to prevent gout flares in people starting uric acid-lowering therapy.To test its drug, Regeneron gave it to patients for 16 weeks, the length of time it said most people experience gout flare-ups. But panel members said in the most severe cases, people would need to take the drug for longer periods.Shares of Regeneron, the maker of eye drug Eylea, closed up 0.5 percent on Nasdaq at $130.93. If approved, most analysts said the drug would contribute about $2 to $3 to the small biotech company’s share price."

2012-7-18,Surge in biotech deals to unlock big investor profits,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE86H0EY20120719,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Large investors in U.S. biotech companies are likely to capture serious windfall profits as deal activity picks up in the sector.A Reuters analysis of investors’ average cost found that six U.S. biotech companies flagged as potential takeover targets could yield billions of dollars in profits for their major shareholders at current share prices.Ownership of these companies is dominated by a handful of institutional investors, such as Wellington Management, Fidelity Management & Research, Capital Group Cos and T Rowe Price Associates. They have seen the value of their holdings increase as takeover speculation drove up biotech shares, with the Nasdaq biotech index up about 29 percent this year.Deals such as GlaxoSmithKline Plc’s $3 billion purchase of Human Genome Sciences Inc on Monday have fed that speculation and led to a 63 percent increase in U.S. biotech M&A volume so far this year, according to Thomson Reuters. Bankers predict the trend will continue, as demand for new drugs by big pharma drives the buying spree.Despite the run up in share prices, the analysis shows a silver lining for potential acquirers. Investors already in the money may be more amenable to selling out of positions they have sometimes held for more than a decade.To be sure, shareholder cost basis is only one data point for investors and acquirers to consider. A company’s existing drugs, pipeline, therapeutic area and an acquirer’s strategic needs would all play key roles in a deal.But by estimating the average cost of holdings by major investors, the Reuters analysis sheds new light on deals that could lie ahead for the biotech sector.“When investing in biotech stocks, I am not speculating that a big pharma company is going to come in and scoop it up,” said Rajiv Kaul, portfolio manager of Fidelity Investments’ Select Biotechnology Portfolio. “If I see value in a biotech stock, it’s possible a big pharma firm may see value in them as well.”The Reuters analysis looked at eight U.S. biotech companies that Morningstar analysts had flagged as potential targets in 2012. The analysis also includes two other healthcare firms that were in play. The findings show that buyouts of six companies would unlock substantial gains for the shareholders.The six are: Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc, BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc, Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, Seattle Genetics Inc and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.For example, Wellington, which has about $719 billion in client assets under management, has an estimated average cost of $1.46 per share in Regeneron as of March 31. Regeneron’s stock closed at $122.02 on Tuesday. Other major shareholders in the maker of eye drug Eylea are also substantially in the money.The companies and investors either declined to comment or were not available for comment.The analysis is based on the investors’ stock holding reports, going back to the earliest available disclosures with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. It calculates the average cost, weighted by both the trading volume over each quarter and the shareholders’ own transactions over the years. The analysis looks at investors with at least 5 percent of the outstanding stock.The estimate, which is based on data through March 31, can differ from the actual cost, especially if there are large swings in the share price in any quarter. That can happen in this sector as a result of events like clinical trial results. It can also change significantly from one quarter to the next.For example, the analysis showed Sands Capital Management had 6.2 percent of Regeneron at an estimated cost of $78.44 per share, and 4.8 percent of Alexion at a cost of $42.28 per share. Sands Capital said on Monday that as of May 31, the firm held 6.7 percent of Regeneron at a cost of about $68 per share, and 5.2 percent of Alexion at a cost of around $37 per share.But most shareholders tend not to disclose their actual costs, and bankers and investors say the method yields a good estimate. In the case of Amylin Pharmaceuticals Inc, which was bought last month by Bristol-Myers Squibb Co for $5.3 billion, or $31 per share, activist investor Carl Icahn had an average cost of about $23 per share, a source previously said. The analysis estimates his cost basis at $23.68.Not all of the top biotech takeover candidates would reap a windfall for their shareholders. The biggest shareholders in two companies in Morningstar’s list - Exelixis Inc and Human Genome - have average costs higher than where the stock is currently trading.Fidelity, T Rowe Price and Wellington, which together account for nearly 37 percent of the stock of Exelixis, which makes cancer drugs, are out of the money. Only Capital Research Global Investors, with nearly 6 percent, has a lower cost basis than the current share price, the analysis shows.That could mean these shareholders may demand a high premium from potential bidders - a possible, albeit risky, bet for other investors looking to play the biotech sector.Out-of-the-money holdings can deflect deals, too. Illumina Inc’s shareholders helped the life sciences company thwart a $6.7 billion, or $51 per share, takeover bid by Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG earlier this year.Illumina’s second-largest shareholder, Baillie Gifford & Co - which sources have said pushed back against the bid - had an average cost of $60.54 per share, the analysis shows.A high cost also is no guarantee that shareholders would fight a bid. Investors are at times willing to take a loss, especially if their view of the company is not sanguine.In the case of Human Genome, for example, most of the top shareholders would have been in the red at $14.25 per share, the price at which GSK agreed to buy it.Yet, Human Genome saw 126.5 million shares, or 63.5 percent of its entire float, change hands on April 19 alone, the day GSK’s initial $13 per share bid was revealed, indicating many long-term institutional investors exited the stock while arbitrageurs likely moved in en masse to bet on a deal.One possible reason for the exit was the disappointment around the company’s lupus drug Benlysta, whose sales got off to a slow start. The company’s stock fell 69 percent last year.“Despite the stock trading north of $25 last year, the investment thesis for most fundamental investors fell apart at the end of last year and it would be hard to justify the same price today,” said Ted Chen, an event-driven strategist at Jefferies. “They bought it with the expectation of one outcome. And that one outcome is not going to be feasible anymore.”Still, GSK paid a multiple of 13.2 times Human Genome’s 2012 revenue, more than double the sector median of 6.2 times, according to ISI Group."

2012-7-20,Sanofi eyes 2015 launch of cholesterol drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE86J05P20120720,"(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi SA said it and partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have begun enrolling more than 20,000 patients for late-stage trials of their cholesterol fighter REGN727 and hope the medicine will be approved by late 2015.The injectable drug works by blocking PCSK9, a naturally occurring protein that coaxes the body to hold onto “bad” LDL cholesterol, which is emerging as a promising and competitive new area of drug research.In small earlier trials, REGN727 slashed LDL levels by 40 to 70 percent without any serious side effects.That is comparable to the largest LDL reductions typically seen with standard oral treatments called statins, which include Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor.Some analysts believe REGN727 could generate annual multi-billion dollar sales if it is proven safe and effective and is approved. The medicine would be geared to patients who cannot tolerate statins, as well as to millions of others who do not get their LDL levels down to target levels with statins.“The studies could allow us to have a global launch in 2016, but our goal is for the first launch by the fourth quarter of 2015,” Jay Edelberg, head of Sanofi’s development program for REGN727, said in an interview.Other drugmakers, including Merck & Co and Amgen Inc, are racing to develop their own PCSK9 inhibitors, spurred in part by stellar results seen in earlier small mid-stage trials of REGN727.Roche Holding AG also has an anti-PCSK9 drug in development, known as RG7652, that is due to enter the decisive final Phase III stage of clinical trials in 2013, according to a recent article in an internal Roche newsletter.Edelberg said patients in large Phase III studies would receive injections of REGN727 every two weeks. Most will take it in combination with statins. It will also be tested in separate trials among patients who cannot tolerate statins, as well as among patients with gene mutations which make them and family members highly prone to high cholesterol and heart disease.“Only a few hundred patients have been enrolled, but we hope to roll out all the studies this year,” he said.Edleberg said one of the Phase III trials will test the safety of REGN727 over an extended period, while another especially long study will evaluate the drug’s potential to reduce the incidence of heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems.Some 24 million patients in the United States take statins, the majority of which fail to drive down LDL to target levels, Edelberg said."
2012-7-24,FDA staff say Roche drug helped diabetics see,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE86N0TS20120724,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug reviewers on Tuesday said Roche Holding AG’s eye drug Lucentis appeared to help diabetic patients with a vision-robbing eye condition, and raised few major issues about the drug’s safety.Staff from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reviewed Lucentis ahead of an advisory panel of outside experts, which meets on Thursday to vote on whether to recommend approval of an expanded use of the drug, which is administered monthly by injection.However, the FDA staff asked advisers to consider whether both doses of the drug are equally safe and effective, and should be approved.Lucentis is already approved for two other eye conditions. Roche is hoping to widen its use to people with diabetic macular edema (DME), the most common cause of moderate vision loss in patients with diabetes. There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for DME, a leading cause of vision loss among people of working age.DME is currently treated by laser, which stops blood vessel leakage and can slow vision loss but rarely leads to vision improvement.In clinical trials Lucentis, made by Roche unit Genentech, helped patients see at least 15 extra letters on an eye chart, the primary goal of the study, FDA reviewers said.People were also generally able to sustain the improvement in vision for at least 24 months -- although those who took the 0.5 mg dose lost a bit of vision after the 18th month.Both doses were generally safe, although there were slightly more deaths at the higher dose -- 11 people who received the 0.5 mg dose died during the clinical trials, compared with seven taking the 0.3 mg dose and three receiving a placebo, or sham injection. Each group contained 250 patients.The FDA will ask advisers to recommend whether both doses of the drug should be approved for use against DME.DME is a swelling of the retina that occurs in diabetics who suffer from retinopathy -- the most common diabetic eye disease that involves damaged blood vessels leaking fluid into the retina. It causes blurred vision and severe vision loss.About 75,000 new cases of DME are estimated to develop among Americans each year -- and Genentech said about 560,000 Americans in total are affected by the disease.If approved for DME Lucentis will likely compete with a highly promising drug being tested by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Roche’s own cancer drug Avastin, which works in a similar manner as Lucentis.Roche shares were down slightly at 167.2 Swiss francs. Shares of Regeneron gained $1.00 to $123.50 in mid-day trading on Nasdaq, where they outperformed the wider Arca Pharmaceuticals Index.Avastin, which is not approved for eye disease, costs a fraction of the Lucentis price when cut into the small doses needed for eye injection. It has been used extensively off-label in place of Lucentis, hurting sales of the eye drug.A U.S. government study last year found the two drugs to be similarly effective for macular degeneration treatment.Genentech has said Avastin increased the risk of stroke and heart attack in cancer trials and noted that diabetics are already at much higher risk for serious heart problems.Lucentis is already approved to treat wet age-related macular degeneration -- the leading cause of blindness among the elderly. It is also approved for macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a swelling or thickening of the part of the retina responsible for central vision."
2012-7-25,Regeneron boosts Eylea sales forecast,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE86O1EB20120725,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O significantly boosted its 2012 sales forecast for its new eye drug Eylea for the third time this year as second-quarter sales of the sight-restoring medicine cruised past Wall Street's rising expectations.The biotechnology company said on Wednesday that it expected full-year U.S. Eylea sales of $700 million to $750 million. In April, it had forecast Eylea sales of $500 million to $550 million, nearly double its previous projection.Shares in Regeneron surged as much as 11.5 percent in early trading on Wednesday, but gave back much of those gains and were up 5.3 percent in afternoon trading.BMO Capital Markets analyst Jim Birchenough called the second quarter results “phenomenal” and said the muted stock response was likely due to concerns over potentially slowing Eylea growth in the second half of the year as initial patients move from monthly dosing in the first three months of treatment to less frequent injections.“We would advise looking past that to all the growth drivers beyond the second half of this year,” said Birchenough, who raised his rating on Regeneron stock to “buy” from “market perform” and his price target to $158 from $143. “Once we get to a steady state of dosing frequency, we think there is a lot of room for market share gains, a lot of room for geographic expansion and a lot of room for label expansion.”J.P. Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham, in a research note, said questions remain regarding the durability of Eylea growth given the potential for competition on the intermediate-term horizon.Privately-held biotechnology company Ophthotech last month released promising data from a mid-stage clinical trial of an eye drug that could become a strong future rival to Eylea.Second-quarter sales of the Eylea, which since its November approval has been gaining market share from Roche Holding AG's ROG.VX Lucentis and off-label use of the cancer drug Avastin, were $194 million, up 57 percent from the previous quarter.On Tuesday, Robert W. Baird analysts raised their Eylea sales forecast for the quarter to $155 million, ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations of about $143 million, and even that proved to be not aggressive enough.“If we hit our new forecast we will be one of the best launches in the history of the biotechnology industry,” Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in a telephone interview.“We got a very good label for the product that clearly stated what we think are its advantages to patients, and doctors tried the product and I think were very pleased,” he said of the early success.Eylea treats wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) -- the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Like its Roche rivals, it has shown an ability to restore some lost vision, but offers the advantage of roughly half as many injections in the eye as well as a lower cost than Lucentis.“We’re taking market share based on new patients, based on people switching from Lucentis and based on people switching from Avastin,” said Schleifer, who estimated that Eylea currently has about 14 percent of the AMD market, giving it plenty of room to grow.“There’s an opportunity to grow this product in the United States, based on increasing the market share as well as hopefully getting new indications,” the CEO said. “There’s also the possibility to grow product revenues for us based on geographic expansion.”Regeneron owns full U.S. rights to Eylea and will get about half the profits from any overseas sales from marketing partner Bayer Ag BAYGn.DE.Regeneron posted second-quarter net profit of $76.7 million, or 70 cents per share, marking its second profitable quarter. The company posted a loss of $62.5 million, or 69 cents per share, in the year-ago quarter.Revenue of $304 million for the quarter easily beat Wall Street expectations of $257 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Regeneron shares were up $6.46 or 5.3 percent, at $127.90 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.The company is not expected to depend solely on Eylea for long as Regeneron has several other promising products in development for a variety of disease categories.“We have a robust pipeline of about a dozen different things in clinical development at all stages,” Schleifer said. “The best we hope may be yet to come.”"

2012-7-26,U.S. health advisers back two new eye treatments,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2E8IQ88M20120726,"* Panel recommends Roche’s Lucentis for macular edema* Same experts say ThomboGenic’s ocriplasmin is effectiveWASHINGTON, July 26 (Reuters) - A U.S. Food and Drug Administration panel on Thursday recommended two drugs for combating different forms of vision loss that can lead to blindness among a range of adults, including diabetics and the elderly.The FDA advisory committee of outside experts gave its support to Swiss-based Roche Holding AG’s Lucentis eye drug for treatment of diabetic macular edema and Belgium-based ThromboGenics’ treatment for viteromacular adhesion, a condition that often develops with aging.The recommendations will now be considered by FDA regulators as they decide whether to approve the two injectable drugs for sale in the United States.The news emerged after the companies’ shares had ended trading in Europe. Roche shares closed slightly higher at 168 Swiss francs, while ThromboGenics fell 4.82 percent to 23.30 euros.The panel gave its blessing to both 0.3 milligram and 0.5 milligram doses of Roche’s drug, known generically as ranibizumab, after reviewing clinical research showing it clearly helps diabetic patients who suffer from diabetic macular edema, or DME.However, some panel members expressed concern about evidence linking higher doses of the drug to adverse events, including death.Lucentis, which is made by Roche unit Genentech and administered by monthly injection, is already approved for two other eye ailments.“The committee’s recommendation is an important step towards improving the care of Americans with diabetic macular edema. If approved by the FDA, this will be the first major development for treating diabetic macular edema in more than 25 years,” Genentech said in a statement.The leading cause of vision loss among diabetics, DME occurs when leaking blood vessels in the eye cause swelling at the center of the retina. The result is a progressive blurring of images near the center of a patient’s field of vision, and sometimes blindness.About 75,000 new cases of DME are estimated to develop among Americans each year. Genentech says that about 560,000 in total are affected by the disease.There are currently no FDA-approved drugs for DME. The condition is currently treated by laser surgery to stop blood vessels from leaking. The treatment can slow vision loss, but it rarely leads to vision improvement.Lucentis is already approved to treat wet age-related macular degeneration - the leading cause of blindness among the elderly. It is also approved for macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a swelling or thickening of the part of the retina responsible for central vision.If approved for DME, Lucentis will likely compete with a highly promising drug being tested by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Roche’s own cancer drug, Avastin, which works in a similar manner as Lucentis.Regeneron shares closed 5.3 percent higher at $135.64 on Nasdaq following the advisory panel’s decision.The same FDA committee later concluded that ThromboGenics’ injectable drug, known generically as ocriplasmin, helped enough people in clinical trials to warrant a favorable review, despite evidence of adverse effects, including eye pain, swelling and blurred vision.Several panel members recommended further studies to monitor safety and determine more fully the drug’s effectiveness.Vitreomacular adhesion often results from aging and can lead to visual impairment or blindness. But it currently can be treated only through surgery.It occurs when vitreous gel detaches at the back of the eye but adheres to the retina as it pulls away, distorting vision and causing small breaks to develop in the macula, a portion of the retina that is important for central vision.Ocriplasmin is ThromboGenics’ main drug. The company has secured a deal to sell ocriplasmin in 40 countries outside the United States through Novartis AG’s opthalmic division, Alcon.ThromboGenics plans to market the product itself within the United States."
2012-7-30,FDA rejects expanded use of Regeneron drug for gout,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE86U03Z20120731,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said U.S. regulators have denied approval for it to expand use of its Arcalyst drug to prevent gout flares, asking that the company provide more clinical data.The rejection follows a unanimous vote against the drug’s approval in early May by advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, with panel members expressing concern that the company had only done a 16-week study.The agency has requested additional clinical data, including chemistry, manufacturing and controls information related to a proposed new dosage form for the injectable drug, Arcalyst, Regeneron said in a statement.Regeneron, which had pitched Arcalyst for approval to treat gout flares in patients starting uric acid-lowering therapy, said it was reviewing the FDA’s requests.Patients afflicted with gout experience severe pain and inflammation due to deposits of uric acid -- a body waste product -- in the joints and soft tissues.Known generically as rilonacept, Arcalyst is already on the market to treat a group of rare genetic auto-inflammatory diseases. It only contributes modestly to Regeneron’s overall sales.Regeneron is better known for its recently approved Eylea to treat macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. Arcalyst brought in sales of $6 million in the April-June period, while Eylea’s sales shot up 57 percent to $194 million.New York-based Regeneron’s shares closed at $135.47 on Monday on the Nasdaq."

2012-8-03,FDA approves Sanofi\\/Regeneron colon cancer drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8721Q720120803,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said on Friday that it had approved the Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc drug Zaltrap for patients with metastatic colorectal cancer whose tumors have failed to respond to earlier treatment with chemotherapy.The infused medicine, to be taken in combination with standard chemotherapy, will compete with Roche Holding AG’s Avastin and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co’s Erbitux.Industry analysts say they expect Zaltrap to win peak annual sales of perhaps $300 million to $400 million, well below the widely used older treatments.Patients taking Zaltrap in a large clinical trial, in combination with a standard chemotherapy combination regimen called FOLFIRI, lived an average of 13.5 months, compared with 12 months for those receiving only FOLFIRI. Also, patients receiving Zaltrap went an average 6.9 months before their symptoms got worse, compared with 4.7 months for those on chemotherapy alone.Zaltrap, like Avastin but through a different approach, blocks a protein called VEGF that tumors employ to create blood vessels that provide them nutrients. Erbitux blocks receptors to a different protein, called epidermal growth factor.“This is a very solid new opportunity” for Regeneron,” said RW Baird analyst Christopher Raymond, who predicted the medicine would garner sales of $205 million in 2015. But Raymond said most proceeds in the next few years will likely go to partner Sanofi, which is entitled not only to a half share of profits from Zaltrap but also to reimbursement from Regeneron for half the drug’s development costs funded by Sanofi.Regeneron is far better known for Eylea, a treatment approved late last year for treating macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. The eye medicine has the same active ingredient as Zaltrap, called aflibercept, and is already achieving blockbuster sales and stealing market share from Roche’s Lucentis treatment for the eye condition. Lucentis is derived from Avastin.“While near-term we expect (Regeneron’s) stock will continue to trade primarily on the Eylea launch which remains impressive, we view Zaltrap’s approval as a nice complement to what is rapidly becoming one of biotech’s best commercial stories,” Raymond said.The company, based in Tarrytown, New York, has a promising array of other drugs in development with Sanofi to treat cancer, cholesterol and inflammatory diseases.Adnan Butt, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said he has particularly high hopes for REGN727, which slashed levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by more than 60 percent in a mid-stage study and is now being tested in far larger Phase III studies. It blocks a protein called PCSK9, a new approach.He also cited REGN88, a treatment being tested against rheumatoid arthritis that works by blocking a protein called IL-6.“They are both potential blockbuster medicines,” Butt said.Regeneron shares, which rose 0.4 percent to $136.96 on Friday, have soared 250 percent since the FDA approved Eylea on November 18.Regeneron research chief George Yancopoulos said anti-angiogenesis drugs, like Zaltrap and Avastin, have not been able to slow down tumor growth nearly as well as researchers had originally hoped.“We thought if you could choke off the blood supply you could, if not kill the tumor, keep it from growing. But (targeting) VEGF may not be enough, we may have to combine different types of anti-angiogenesis drugs.”Toward that end, Yancopoulos said Regeneron and Sanofi are testing two such medicines, which instead block proteins DLL4 and angiopoietin 2, that could someday be used in combination with anti-VEGF therapies to more fully cut off blood supply to tumors.Zaltrap, like Avastin, was shown to be ineffective in treating prostate cancer. It also failed in other studies to improve outcomes in patients with lung and pancreatic cancers.Colorectal cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States, and the fourth leading cause of cancer death, the FDA said. Almost 145,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with the disease this year, and almost 52,000 will die from the cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health."

2012-8-10,U.S. FDA widens use of Roche eye drug for diabetics,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE8790TC20120810,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. drug regulators gave the nod to a wider use for Roche Holding AG’s eye drug Lucentis, approving it for diabetic patients with a vision-robbing eye condition.Lucentis, made by Roche unit Genentech, is already prescribed for two other eye ailments.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval makes it available for people with diabetic macular edema, or DME, the most common cause of blindness in people of working age.The once-monthly injection is now the only FDA-approved drug specifically targeted at DME. But a highly promising candidate from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc may be not too far behind.DME is a swelling of the retina that occurs in diabetics who suffer from retinopathy, the most common eye disease for people with diabetes. In people affected by DME, damaged blood vessels leak fluid into the retina. This causes blurred vision and severe vision loss.In 2010, about 3.9 million adults diagnosed with diabetes reported trouble with their vision, the FDA said.DME has long been treated by laser, which stops blood vessel leakage. Laser treatment can slow vision loss, but rarely leads to vision improvement.Insulin, which helps people with diabetes control their blood sugar, is also approved for DME, the FDA said, as better-controlled diabetes reduces the likelihood of vision loss.In clinical trials, Lucentis helped people see at least 15 extra letters on an eye chart. People were also generally able to sustain the vision improvement for at least 24 months. But they have to continue taking the drug to maintain the benefits.“Today’s approval represents a major development for the treatment of people whose vision is impaired by DME,” said Dr. Renata Albrecht, director of the FDA’s ophthalmology products division.The FDA approved only the 0.3 mg dose of Lucentis, saying a higher dose that was tested showed no extra benefit in vision.Genentech said it would sell the 0.3 mg dose for $1,170, compared with the $1,950 it charges for the 0.5 mg dose used to treat other eye conditions.Lucentis is also approved for wet age-related macular degeneration - the leading cause of blindness among the elderly - and for macular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO), a swelling or thickening of the part of the retina responsible for central vision.For macular degeneration, Lucentis has long competed with Regeneron’s drug Eylea as well as with Roche’s own cancer drug Avastin, which works in a similar manner but for a fraction of the price.Avastin is not approved for eye disease. But some doctors have cut the cancer treatment into the small doses needed for an eye injection, which costs only about $50.A U.S. government study last year found the two drugs to be similarly effective for treating macular degeneration.However, doctors may be more hesitant to use Avastin for patients with diabetes, said Dr. David Brown, a lead investigator for the Lucentis DME trial, and an associate clinical professor at the Methodist Hospital in Houston.“The sense in the retina community, for whatever reason, is that Avastin doesn’t seem to work as well as Lucentis in DME,” Brown said.Roche unit Genentech has also cautioned that Avastin increased the risk of stroke and heart attack in cancer trials, and noted that diabetics are already at much higher risk for serious heart problems.Alfonso Calvo Rodriguez of Port Isabel, Texas, has had diabetes for about 13 years. He was diagnosed with DME in 2008. Soon, his eyesight made it difficult to drive.“I would drive with my binoculars next to me, so I could look at the signs or names of streets,” he said.Rodriguez, 57, was forced to have laser surgery to remove blood from his eyes after hemorrhages. His doctor recommended that he enroll in the Lucentis clinical trial at the Methodist Hospital in Houston.He has been getting monthly injections of the drug for over three years, and said he now needs only glasses to drive.“I can do just about anything,” he said. “I can read. I can work on my computer. I can drive perfectly fine and see the signs on the streets. I’m sure I’d be blind if I didn’t have the injections.”The FDA said about 34 percent to 45 percent of those treated with the 0.3 mg dose of Lucentis in clinical trials had vision improvement, compared with 12 percent to 18 percent of those getting no injection.Common side effects included eye pain, increased pressure inside the eye, and bleeding of the conjunctiva, the tissue that lines the inside of the eyelids and covers the white part of the eye."
2012-9-21,Regeneron eye drug Eylea wins U.S. approval for new use,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE88K16N20120921,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said U.S. health regulators approved the company’s eye drug Eylea for a new use, potentially boosting the already soaring sales of the drug that treats a sight-robbing condition.With the approval, Eylea can now be used to treat the thickening of the macula of the eye that sometimes follows central retinal vein occlusion - a blockage of the veins that carry blood away from the eye.The macula is an area of the retina that is responsible for central vision and its thickening or swelling can lead to vision impairment.Over 100,000 people in the United States are estimated to suffer from central retinal vein occlusion, the company said in a statement.Eylea won U.S. approval last November to treat age-related macular degeneration - the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.Since its launch, Eylea has surpassed Wall Street expectations for its sales. The strong numbers have also prompted Regeneron to raise its forecast for the drug’s sales for the third time this year to between $700 million and $750 million in 2012.New York-based Regeneron’s shares were mostly flat at $145.22 late Friday afternoon on the Nasdaq."
2012-9-21,"New Bayer, Regeneron eye drug gets EU agency backing",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE88K0MW20120921,"LONDON (Reuters) - EU drugs regulators have recommended Regeneron’s and Bayer’s eye drug Eylea for approval in a move likely to see the new medicine eat away further at rival Roche’s market share.Eylea treats wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) -- the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.Like its Roche rival Lucentis, it has been shown to restore some lost vision, but also offers the advantage of roughly half as many injections in the eye, as well as a lower cost.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) said on Friday its expert committee considered the benefits of Eylea were its ability to preserve visual acuity, demonstrated over two years of treatment, by interfering with the progression of AMD.It noted the most common side effects are conjunctival hemorrhage and eye pain, and said a drug monitoring plan would be implemented as part of the marketing authorization.Recommendations for drug approvals by the EMA are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months.In July, Regeneron significantly boosted its 2012 sales forecast for Eylea for the third time this year - raising its predictions to $750 million.The U.S. biotech said second-quarter sales of the Eylea, which since its November approval has been gaining market share from Roche’s Lucentis, were $194 million, up 57 percent from the previous quarter.Regeneron has full marketing rights to Eylea in the United States and has a deal to share profits in Europe and other markets equally with Bayer.Novartis sells Lucentis outside the United States."
2012-9-27,Bayer wins early U.S. approval for colon cancer drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE88Q13820120927,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Thursday approved a new drug for advanced colon cancer developed by Bayer AG, a month ahead of the agency’s expected action date for a decision.The drug, to be sold under the brand name Stivarga, was approved to treat colon cancer that has progressed after prior treatment or that has spread to other parts of the body, the agency said.“Someone has clearly lit a fire under the FDA,” Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges said of the speedy approval. “We’re seeing a fairly consistent pattern of drugs for high unmet needs diseases being approved on an expedited basis.”Bayer said Stivarga will be ready for distribution as soon as Friday and set a wholesale price for the drug of $9,350 for a 28-day cycle of treatment.In pivotal clinical trials, Stivarga - known chemically as regorafenib - helped severely ill patients live on average 1.4 months longer than those who received standard treatment without the Bayer drug. Stivarga plus standard care also delayed tumor growth for an average of two months compared with 1.7 months for standard care alone.Bayer is currently awaiting a colon cancer approval decision for the drug in Europe and is also seeking U.S. approval of regorafenib as a treatment for gastrointestinal stromal tumors.“Stivarga is the latest colorectal cancer treatment to demonstrate an ability to extend patients’ lives and is the second drug approved for patients with colorectal cancer in the past two months,” Richard Pazdur, director of the Office of Hematology and Oncology Products in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said in a statement.In August, the FDA approved Zaltrap, an advanced colon cancer treatment from Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc is entitled to a 20 percent royalty payment on global net sales of Stivarga under a settlement agreement with Bayer following a dispute over how closely related the medicine is to Nexavar, the kidney and liver cancer drug that the companies co-developed and share.Bayer and Onyx will jointly promote Stivarga in the United States.Porges, Bernstein’s biotechnology analyst, called the Onyx royalty agreement, “a fairly attractive deal.”But he said initial sales expectations for Stivarga are relatively modest “because this is really a relatively small indication late in the disease.”However, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover forecast sales of the drug reaching $1 billion by 2020. Bayer declined to provide its own sales forecast for the medicine.“Bayer has very high expectations for Stivarga,” Shannon Campbell, head of oncology for Bayer Healthcare, said in a telephone interview. “We certainly expect that Stivarga is going to play an important role once (patients) have gone through some of the more standard infusion based chemotherapies that are out there.”Stivarga is a pill that works by blocking several enzymes that promote cancer growth.The drug was reviewed under the FDA’s priority review program that provides an expedited six-month review for drugs that offer major advances in treatment or that provide treatment when no adequate therapy exists. A decision had been expected by October 27.The Stivarga label will include a warning that severe and fatal liver toxicity occurred in some patients treated with the medicine during clinical studies, the FDA said.In addition to Zaltrap, Stivarga will likely also compete with Roche Holding AG’s multibillion-dollar cancer drug Avastin and Erbitux from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Eli Lilly and Co.An estimated 143,460 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer, and 51,690 will die from the disease in 2012, according to the National Institutes of Health.Bayer shares rose 1.3 percent to 68.40 euros in Germany.Onyx shares were up 2.8 percent at $84.85 on Nasdaq."
2013-1-08,Regeneron sees 2013 U.S. sales of Eylea up to $1.3 bln,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1E9C865Q20130108,"* Says 4th-quarter Eylea sales were $276 million* Sees substantial opportunity for growth outside U.S.* Shares down 5.2 percent (Adds CEO comment from presentation, share price)Jan 8 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Tuesday forecast U.S. sales of its fast-growing eye drug, Eylea, of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion in 2013.Wall Street was disappointed by the initial sales outlook, sending Regeneron’s high-flying shares down 5 percent. Regeneron’s share price more than tripled in 2012 as the U.S. biotechnology company repeatedly raised its Eylea sales forecast over the course of the year.Regeneron said sales of the product for wet age-related macular degeneration - the leading cause of blindness among the elderly - were $276 million in the fourth quarter and $838 million for 2012.Regeneron Chief Executive Len Schleifer, speaking at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, pointed out that Eylea recorded strong fourth-quarter sales despite major holidays and a giant storm that disrupted business in the Northeast.Schleifer, whose comments were monitored via webcast, called Eylea’s first year “one of the top launches in the history of our industry.”Noting that Tuesday is the 25th anniversary of the start of the company, Schleifer quipped, “we thought we’d be successful. We just thought we’d be successful a lot quicker.”In addition to increasing Eylea’s U.S. sales through new patients and approvals for additional uses, such as diabetic macular edema and retinal vein occlusion, Schleifer called the opportunity for Eylea sales outside the United States “very substantial.”He said the company was working with partner Bayer AG to launch the drug in several countries.“We know we’re in for a dogfight. Novartis is very tough, but Bayer is up to the task,” Schleifer said. Novartis AG markets Eylea’s main rival, Roche Holding AG’s Lucentis, outside the United States.Regeneron shares were down 5.2 percent at $173.11 on the Nasdaq on Tuesday.

2013-10-16,"Regeneron, Sanofi drug slashes cholesterol in late-stage trial",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0I60AV20131016,"Oct 16 (Reuters) - A new type of cholesterol drug being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA, when used by itself, cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol almost in half in the first of a dozen late-stage trials of the injectable medicine.The experimental drug, called alirocumab, is from a promising new class of injectable cholesterol fighters also being developed by Amgen Inc and other drugmakers. They work by blocking a naturally occurring protein called PCSK9 and could each garner annual sales of $3 billion or more, if approved, according to some industry analysts.In earlier mid-stage studies, when combined with standard oral cholesterol drugs called statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, alirocumab and Amgen’s AMG145 slashed levels of LDL cholesterol by close to 70 percent more than statins alone.But the 103-patient Phase III study described on Wednesday involved patients who took alirocumab by itself, or who took only Merck & Co Inc’s cholesterol fighter Zetia (ezetimibe) - a pill often used by patients who cannot tolerate statins.Although patients enrolled in the Regeneron/Sanofi trial had high cholesterol levels, they were deemed to have only moderate cardiovascular risk due to the absence of many other risk factors.Regeneron and Sanofi said LDL cholesterol levels fell 47 percent in those who gave themselves injections of low-dose alirocumab every two weeks over a 24-week period. Cholesterol levels fell 15.6 percent in those taking daily 10-milligram doses of Zetia over the same period.George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s research chief, said no worrisome side effects were seen in the study and in earlier trials of alirocumab.“What we’re seeing in first Phase III trial of our drug is in line with what we saw in Phase II” trials, Yancopoulos said in an interview. “The good news here is there were no surprises, and that it supports the good efficacy and safety profile we’ve seen to date.”In the study, called Odyssey Mono, patients taking alirocumab started out with a low 75-milligram dose every two weeks. But their doses were increased to 150 milligrams at week 12 if their LDL levels at week eight were above 70.About three-fourths of the patients remained on the low dose of alirocumab throughout the study because they got their LDL levels down to below 70 - an aggressive LDL target - by the eighth week of the study.“It shows that a low dose, when used as a monotherapy, can be quite effective,” Yancopoulos said.Yancopoulos said Regeneron and Sanofi hope to seek regulatory approvals by late 2015 for their drug, for use by itself and with statins, after data from the remaining 11 late-stage trials of alirocumab are released. An estimated 23,000 patients are being studied in the various Phase III trials.The Regeneron research chief said Amgen’s rival drug might reach market soon after alirocumab, or even before. But he predicted neither drug would have much of an advantage by getting approved first.“But we’re hoping to have bragging rights for the first approval,” Yancopoulos said.Regeneron and Sanofi are hoping their new medicine will be a compelling treatment option for the estimated 1 million Americans who cannot tolerate statins and up to another 5 million Americans who have failed to drive down their cholesterol levels to desired levels with statins.Analysts believe strong demand from outside the United States could also propel blockbuster sales of alirocumab and rival products.At an investor conference in September, Sanofi’s CEO Chris Viehbacher said the French drugmaker could look at nearly doubling its stake in Regeneron, voicing confidence in the drug’s success. Sanofi holds about 16 percent of Regeneron.Deutsche Bank analysts said in a report last month that the new drug could be priced at around $15 per day, comparable to the cost of injectable diabetes drugs known as GLP-1s, such as Novo Nordisk’s Victoza."

2013-10-21,Regeneron\'s Eylea beats laser in eye-edema study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0IB3B220131021,"(Adds details about Eylea, study findings, share price)Oct 21 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said its drug Eylea improved vision in a late-stage trial far better than standard laser treatment among patients with a common form of vision loss caused by blood clots in secondary veins of the retina.Eylea has become a blockbuster product since winning U.S. approval in November 2011 to treat the “wet” form of age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in which leaky blood vessels in the central part of the retina can endanger sight.The injectable drug is also approved for macular edema - meaning fluid buildup under the central area of the retina - that occurs after central retinal vein occlusion, which is blockage of the retina’s major vein. Both macular edema and retinal vein occlusion can cause vision loss.Regeneron on Monday described results from a Phase III study called Vibrant, which tested 183 patients with macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, meaning blockages within branches of the central retinal vein. Such blockages can cause blood and fluid to back up and spill into the retina.Some 53 percent of the patients who received Eylea injections every four weeks for 24 weeks gained at least 15 letters in vision, an eye chart test measuring sharpness of vision. That was deemed better by a highly statistical margin than the 27 percent of patients who achieved such vision gains with standard laser treatment.Laser treatment cauterizes leaky blood vessels in the eye, to stop the leakage that leads to vision loss.The company said 9.9 percent of patients in the Eylea group experienced serious adverse events, compared with 9.8 percent in the laser group.There was one serious adverse event in a patient receiving Eylea, Regeneron said. The patient suffered from a traumatic cataract, a cataract which is related to eye injury.Regeneron said common adverse events were bleeding from broken blood vessels in the eye and pain in the eye.Based on results of the Vibrant study, Regeneron said it plans within several months to seek U.S. approval to market Eylea for treatment of macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion.Eylea in previous trials has also been shown to be significantly better than laser treatment at improving vision in diabetics who have macular edema.Regeneron shares were down 1.4 percent at $299.30 on Monday morning on the Nasdaq, amid slight declines for the drug sector.The company has U.S. rights to Eylea, and equally shares profit from the drug outside the United States with longtime partner Bayer AG.U.S. sales of Eylea rose 70 percent in the second quarter to $330 million. Regeneron expects the drug to garner full-year sales of up to $1.35 billion. Eylea has been steadily grabbing market share from Roche Holding’s similar drug, Lucentis."

Both conditions cause vision loss.Regeneron on Monday said 53 percent of the patients who received Eylea gained at least 15 letters in vision, a measure of sharpness of vision, compared to 27 percent for those who received the standard therapy of laser treatment.The trial tested 183 patients with macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion, a common disease in the elderly.The company said 9.9 percent of patients in the Eylea group experienced serious adverse events, compared to 9.8 percent in the laser group.There was one serious adverse event in a patient receiving Eylea, Regeneron said.

2013-10-22,U.S. drug giant Amgen raises full-year revenue outlook,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0IC1V620131022,"Oct 22 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc, which this month closed a nearly $10 billion acquisition of cancer drug maker Onyx Pharmaceuticals, reported higher-than-expected, third-quarter profit as results were helped by a large U.S. government order for one of its white blood cell boosters.Amgen raised its full-year revenue forecast and pushed up the low end of its earnings forecast range by 5 cents. The company now expects 2013 adjusted earnings of $7.35 to $7.45 per share and sees revenue of $18.3 billion to $18.5 billion, up from its previous view of $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion.The raised revenue view includes expectations of sales in the fourth quarter from Onyx products, including the new multiple myeloma drug Kyprolis, the company said.Kyprolis sales grew a modest 6 percent from the previous quarter to $65 million prior to the closing of the acquisition. The ultimate prospects for the drug are likely to hinge on results of a clinical trial due next year that tests its use earlier in the course of the blood cancer, which could significantly expand use of the medicine.Excluding special items, the company earned $1.94 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations of $1.77, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Without the $155 million government order for Neupogen, RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said, “the core business was in line with expectations...“The new products continue to grow and that’s good. And they raised guidance, but because they didn’t raise the (earnings per share) guidance by how much they beat, that would imply a slightly less robust quarter in Q4,” Yee said.Still, Amgen shares rose about 1 percent in after hours trading to $117.50 from their Nasdaq close at $116.21.The world’s largest biotechnology company said on Tuesday net profit rose to $1.37 billion, or $1.79 per share, from $1.1 billion, or $1.41 per share, a year ago.Revenue for the quarter rose 10 percent to $4.74 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $4.6 billion.Combined sales of Neupogen and Neulasta, used to fight infections by raising white blood cell count, jumped 18 percent to $1.6 billion, exceeding Wall Street estimates of $1.39 billion.Earlier on Tuesday the company announced that it had repurchased the sales rights to the two drugs in several emerging markets from Roche Holding AG. It said sales in those countries last year were about $200 million.Sales of Amgen’s newer products Xgeva, to prevent fractures in cancer that has spread to bones, and the related osteoporosis drug Prolia, continued to see healthy growth.Xgeva sales rose 30 percent to $261 million, in line with analysts’ expectations, while Prolia sales jumped 62 percent to $178 million, somewhat shy of Wall Street estimates of about $187 million.The blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug, Enbrel, saw sales grow 7 percent to $1.16 billion. Beginning next month, Pfizer Inc’s share of Enbrel sales reverts back to Amgen and becomes a 12 percent royalty payment. Amgen said that is expected to add $800 million to operating income in 2014.Amgen said it has fully enrolled patients for the pivotal late stage trials of its high profile cholesterol drug AMG-145, or evolucumab, from a new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. Results for the drug that will, for the first time, put Amgen into cardiovascular care are due early in 2014.Analysts see the PCSK9 drugs in development as having multibillion-dollar potential. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in partnership with Sanofi and Pfizer are also developing drugs in the class that have shown an ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol.“2014 is going to be more about Kyprolis and PCSK9. It will be all about a new products story,” RBC’s Yee said."
2013-10-29,"Pfizer 3rd-qtr profit beats estimates, oncology drugs shine",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0IJ0GC20131029,"Oct 29 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by cuts in costs and growing sales of cancer medicines approved over the past two years.The largest U.S. drugmaker, whose shares rose 1.7 percent, earned $2.59 billion, or 39 cents per share. That compared with $3.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, in last year’s quarter.Excluding special charges of $572 million related to restructurings, asset writedowns and other costs, Pfizer earned 58 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 56 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.“I like the quarter; it was better than we expected, mainly from cost cutting and a lower tax rate,” said Herman Saftlas, an analyst with S&P Capital Inc. The effective tax rate fell 0.4 percent to 27.6 percent in the quarter.Saftlas raised his 12-month share-price target on Pfizer to $35, from $33, saying the company will report data in coming months from trials of a number of promising experimental drugs and from studies testing new uses of its already marketed drugs.“My feeling is they are making traction on their pipeline and if they get some good readouts from these trials, we could see Pfizer shares go higher,” Saftlas said.The bright spot in Pfizer’s earnings report was sales of its oncology drugs, which jumped 24 percent to $407 million.Oncology has become one of Pfizer’s biggest priorities, with the introductions of Xalkori for lung cancer in 2011, Inlyta for kidney cancer in 2012 and Bosulif this year for chronic myelogenous leukemia.Pfizer is counting on them to become lucrative products, and is developing other cancer medicines with possibly far bigger sales potential.

2013-10-29,"Pfizer third-quarter profit beats estimates, oncology drugs shine",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE99S0I220131029,"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc reported better-than-expected third-quarter earnings on Tuesday, helped by cuts in costs and growing sales of cancer medicines approved over the past two years.The largest U.S. drugmaker, whose shares rose 1.7 percent, earned $2.59 billion, or 39 cents per share. That compared with $3.21 billion, or 43 cents per share, in last year’s quarter.Excluding special charges of $572 million related to restructurings, asset writedowns and other costs, Pfizer earned 58 cents per share. Analysts, on average, expected 56 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.“I like the quarter; it was better than we expected, mainly from cost cutting and a lower tax rate,” said Herman Saftlas, an analyst with S&P Capital Inc. The effective tax rate fell 0.4 percent to 27.6 percent in the quarter.Saftlas raised his 12-month share-price target on Pfizer to $35, from $33, saying the company will report data in coming months from trials of a number of promising experimental drugs and from studies testing new uses of its already marketed drugs.“My feeling is they are making traction on their pipeline and if they get some good readouts from these trials, we could see Pfizer shares go higher,” Saftlas said.The bright spot in Pfizer’s earnings report was sales of its oncology drugs, which jumped 24 percent to $407 million.Oncology has become one of Pfizer’s biggest priorities, with the introductions of Xalkori for lung cancer in 2011, Inlyta for kidney cancer in 2012 and Bosulif this year for chronic myelogenous leukemia.Pfizer is counting on them to become lucrative products, and is developing other cancer medicines with possibly far bigger sales potential.

2013-10-30,China slowdown and vaccine glitch hit drugmaker Sanofi,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0IK0ZJ20131030,"* Q3 sales down 6.7 pct, EPS down 19 pct* Sanofi says now sees 2013 EPS down about 10 pct* Sales growth in China slows to 5 pct from 15 pct in Q2* Sanofi sees return to growth in Q4* Shares erase losses, up 2.4 pct (Recasts with detail, analyst comments, share move)By Natalie HuetPARIS, Oct 30 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi lowered its 2013 profit guidance for a second time after a slowdown in China, weaker generic sales in Brazil and manufacturing problems at a Toronto vaccine plant dented third-quarter results.Sanofi said it now expected full-year earnings per share around 10 percent lower than in 2012 at constant exchange rates, having previously signalled a 7-10 percent drop.However, Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher told reporters that the problems encountered during the quarter were largely one-offs that the company had now put behind it.“We’re confident about being able to get back to growth in the fourth quarter,” he said on a conference call.After opening 2 percent lower, Sanofi shares were up 2.4 percent at 1040 GMT, outperforming the Euro Stoxx Healthcare Index and giving Sanofi a market value of around 102 billion euros, the second-biggest on France’s blue-chip index behind oil major Total.Analysts noted that while vaccines and emerging markets had weakened, Sanofi’s diabetes and Genzyme rare diseases businesses continued to post double-digit growth. They said the company, with most of the impact of lost patents now behind it, was ready for a recovery in profit.“Overall, a weak quarter, yet the company returns to a period where growth should be steady and comparatively strong versus many peer companies,” Bernstein analyst Timothy Anderson wrote in a note.Anderson said Sanofi’s performance in emerging markets, and particularly in China, was clearly on the weak side, mirroring problems faced by other drug companies in the quarter.A crackdown on Big Pharma’s sales practices in China, increased government pressure on drug prices from Asia to Latin America, and weakness in emerging market currencies are acting as a reminder that growth in those regions remains volatile.Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline said last week its sales in China had dropped 61 percent in the third quarter, hit by a bribery scandal that made doctors wary of seeing drug representatives.Sanofi’s sales in China - which last year accounted for less than 4 percent of group revenue but posted the strongest growth - rose 5 percent in the third quarter. In the three months to the end of June, before the scandal, growth was 15 percent year-on-year.“There have been investigations ongoing and this creates some confusion in the market place. We are seeing a progressive return to normal circumstances,” Viehbacher said, noting that sales were improving month on month.Worldwide, Sanofi’s sales fell 6.7 percent to 8.432 billion euros ($11.61 billion) in the third quarter, generating earnings per share (EPS) of 1.35 euros, down 19 percent.Analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S on average had forecast sales of 8.55 billion euros and EPS of 1.43 euros.Business net income, which excludes items such as amortisation and legal costs, declined 18.7 percent to 1.789 billion euros.Vaccine sales fell 7.2 percent following the manufacturing problem at Sanofi’s Toronto plant that held back batches of paediatric vaccines destined for the U.S. market.Viehbacher said the problem had been resolved, shipping had restarted and Sanofi did not expect any future impact. The company added that it expected a record flu season in the northern hemisphere in the second half.Generic drug sales were down 5.4 percent due to the lingering impact of inventory issues in Brazil in the previous quarter.Sanofi’s earnings have suffered from the loss of patents on some of its best-selling drugs, including blood thinner Plavix.Since taking the helm four years ago, Viehbacher has sought to replenish its pipeline, acquiring U.S. biotech firm Genzyme in 2011 to develop treatments for rare diseases and partnering with Regeneron on a new cholesterol drug.The company said sales trends had gradually improved in Western Europe over the year. Excluding currency effects, which slashed 7.3 percentage points off revenue growth, global sales were up 0.6 percent, growing for the first time in five quarters.

2013-11-05,"Regeneron earnings beat forecasts, Eylea outlook higher",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0IQ1HX20131105,"Nov 5 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Tuesday reported quarterly profit that beat analyst expectations and again raised its forecast for its high-flying Eylea eye drug, sending its shares up by more than 7 percent.Regeneron, whose stock has been propelled by the success of Eylea, said that U.S. sales of the sight-saving drug rose 49 percent to $363 million in the quarter. The drug also had international sales of $125 million.That represents a slowing of the stunning growth the drug has enjoyed as many patients are able to move to twice-monthly injections from the initial weekly injections of the medicine, used to treat the leading cause of blindness in the elderly - wet age-related macular degeneration.In the previous quarter, Regeneron had reported Eylea growth of 70 percent, which was down from 153 percent growth in the first quarter. The drug has been on the market for two years.The company slightly raised its forecast for 2013 Eylea sales to a range of $1.35 billion to $1.375 billion from its previous forecast of $1.3 billion to $1.35 billion.Despite the slowing growth trend, Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville said, “There’s a lot of opportunity for international growth and growth through new indications.”The company said it has filed an application with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking additional approval for Eylea to treat diabetic macular edema.Regeneron reported net income of $141 million, or $1.25 per share, down from $191 million, or $1.72 per share a year earlier. Analysts had expected third-quarter earnings of 90 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 40 percent to $597 million for the quarter.“Overall it was a very good quarter and there is a lot of interest in their PCSK9 program,” said Quenneville, referring to an experimental drug to lower ‘bad’ LDL cholesterol being developed along with Sanofi that analysts see as a potential multibillion-dollar product.Regeneron shares were up $17.03, or 6 percent, at $298.73 in afternoon trade on Nasdaq, after climbing as high as $302.19 earlier on Tuesday."

2013-11-13,U.S. heart guidelines threaten hot new cholesterol drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9AC0TH20131114,"(Reuters) - New U.S. guidelines on heart health that favor potent statins may threaten future use, or even approval, of a hot new class of experimental cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that have been billed as potential blockbuster treatments, analysts said on Wednesday.But use of Merck & Co’s widely prescribed Zetia, which is not a statin, and Vytorin, a related drug, will likely not be badly hurt anytime soon, analysts said, because doctors will need time to understand and accept the new guidelines.The Merck drugs have combined annual sales of more than $4 billion, or 10 percent of overall company revenue.“I read the new guidelines as a negative for any drugs that aren’t statins, including PCSK9 inhibitors,” said Jon LeCroy, an analyst with MKM Partners.The guidelines, issued by two leading U.S. medical organizations on Tuesday, recommend strong measures for patients at particularly high risk of heart attack or stroke, including use of more potent statins, although not the addition of other types of medicines that have not proven their worth.In fact, statins are the only class of cholesterol-lowering medicines that the guidelines recommend for patients who can tolerate them.The guidelines dropped an emphasis on specific targets for lowering LDL levels. Instead, they suggest that individual patient risk of developing heart disease rather than an LDL number should be used to determine the need for more intensive treatment.Even though Zetia has been on the market since 2002, Merck has not yet proven it reduces heart attack risk and stroke. A costly “outcomes trial” that has been under way for years is expected to answer that question by the second half of 2014.“I don’t think sales of Zetia and Vytorin will fall away rapidly,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss. He said most doctors will wait for the Zetia trial results before abandoning the drug and Vytorin, which pairs Zetia with the generic form of Merck’s statin Zocor (simvastatin).LeCroy expects insurers to eventually put up bigger barriers to use of Zetia and Vytorin because of the guidelines, in favor of cheaper generic statins. “But it will probably take another year before the Merck drugs feel it.”A number of other non-statin cholesterol drugs could eventually also be hurt by the guidelines, analysts said. They include AbbVie Inc’s Niaspan, which raises “good” HDL cholesterol, AbbVie’s Trilipix, used to cut blood fats called triglycerides, and Amarin Corp’s recently approved Vascepa prescription fish oil product.“You need to take a hard look at how much benefit we get from those drugs. If we can’t show that adding drugs to the statin makes a difference, than we have to think twice before doing it,” Dr. Neil Stone, chairman of the panel that wrote the new guidelines, said in a telephone interview.Statins, such as AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor and generic forms of Pfizer Inc’s similarly potent Lipitor (atorvastatin), are the most widely used cholesterol treatments and work by blocking the liver’s production of “bad” LDL cholesterol. Zetia instead works by curbing absorption of cholesterol by the intestines.If the outcomes trial definitively shows that Zetia cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke, Stone said, “then that will have to be taken into account. Guidelines exist to be updated.”Pfizer, Amgen Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi SA are racing to develop the PCSK9 inhibitors, all deemed by Wall Street capable of generating annual sales in the billions of dollars.The injectable drugs have generated excitement in mid-stage trials by slashing levels of LDL cholesterol 60 percent beyond reductions achieved with statins alone, without a pattern of serious side effects.The companies are now conducting late-stage trials of the drugs, which work by blocking a protein called PCSK9, whose natural function is to maintain the presence of LDL in the bloodstream.The drugmakers are hoping the U.S. Food and Drug Administration will approve their PCSK9 inhibitors on the basis of their ability to lower LDL. In the meantime, they are conducting their own outcomes studies to eventually prove to regulators that their medicines actually lower the risk of heart attack and stroke.Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group, said the new heart-protection guidelines “appear to raise the bar for cholesterol-lowering drugs” that are not statins. He said use of Amgen’s PCSK9 inhibitor, called AMG 145 or evolocumab, if it is approved, could be slowed until data from the drug’s outcomes trial arrives in late 2017 or early 2018.Moreover, Schoenebaum said it remains to be seen whether the new guidelines, formulated by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, will affect the willingness of U.S. and European regulators to approve the new class of cholesterol fighters.“These new drugs may be very helpful in getting cholesterol under control, but we’re setting the bar high,” said Stone. “We’re saying show us that in addition to lowering cholesterol that you reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke.”Schoenebaum said Wall Street has been expecting the Amgen drug to generate sales of $1.1 billion in 2018. For now, he said he is sticking to his own sales forecast of $500 million that year and more than $1.4 billion in 2020.“Given the (heart) guidelines, we remain comfortable with our estimates for now but will monitor how the guidelines are perceived by the wider medical community,” Schoenebaum said in a research note.Analysts said sales of Crestor were unlikely to get a big boost from the new guidelines because most doctors would reach instead for less costly generic Lipitor.Shares of Regeneron fell 3.4 percent, those of Amgen rose 0.7 percent and Amarin was unchanged, all on the Nasdaq. Pfizer rose 1.6 percent, Merck dropped 0.5 percent and AbbVie gained 0.8 percent, all on the New York Stock Exchange. Sanofi fell 0.8 percent in Paris, and AstraZeneca shares slipped 0.5 percent in London."

Instead of cutting the body’s production of LDL, as statins do, they prevent the intestines from absorbing LDL.The analysts said most doctors already prescribing the two Merck drugs will probably continue to do so for the next year, until the medical community gets better acquainted with the new heart guidelines.Moreover, they said data from Zetia’s own outcomes trial is expected in the third quarter of 2014, and will definitively show whether it prevents heart attack and stroke.“I don’t think sales of Zetia and Vytorin will fall away rapidly,” said Atlantic Equities analyst Richard Purkiss.

2013-11-19,"Amgen cholesterol drug appears safe, cut LDL 52 percent at 1 year: study",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9AI1DC20131119,"DALLAS (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s experimental heart medicine from a closely watched new class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors lowered “bad” LDL cholesterol 52 percent after one year with no major increase in serious adverse side effects compared with standard drugs, such as statins, according to data from a study.The clinical trial of the drug, evolocumab, marks the first data looking at 52 weeks of use for the new class of injectable biotech medicines seen as potentially the biggest advance in the field of cholesterol therapy in many years.Several companies are developing the drugs, which work by blocking a protein that prevents the liver from removing LDL cholesterol from blood. In addition to Amgen, Pfizer Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi are in advanced stages of testing PCSK9 inhibitors.They are most likely to be used in patients who cannot tolerate statins or those whose LDL cholesterol remains too high even after being treated with high potency statins.“The results from the Osler study are encouraging as evolocumab may offer a potential treatment option for patients who cannot control their cholesterol levels,” said Dr. Michael Koren, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the data on Tuesday at the American Heart Association (AHA) scientific meeting in Dallas.The 1,104-patient trial tested 420 milligrams of evolocumab injected once a month in addition to standard therapy with statins or other medicines versus standard of care drugs alone.After 52 weeks, those who took the Amgen drug saw their LDL levels drop 52 percent on top of statins, which was considered by researchers to be highly statistically significant.Levels of other blood lipids also moved in the beneficial direction, researchers said. Triglycerides went down about 9 percent and “good” HDL went up about 9 percent.Patients in the Osler extension study had previously completed participation in one of four 12-week Phase II studies of the drug.Serious adverse side effects occurred in 7.1 percent of patients treated with evolocumab and standard care compared with 6.3 percent for those who got standard therapy alone.Side effects such as elevated liver enzymes were similar - 1.8 percent for evolocumab versus 1.6 percent in the control group - and a measure of potential kidney problems was 1 percent compared with 1.9 percent.The serious side effects were not felt to be related to evolocumab, said Koren, of the Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida. He added that adverse heart events, such as heart attacks, were slightly higher in the standard of care patients.“It did wonderfully,” Koren said of the Amgen drug, “This gives us a much greater comfort level about possible safety signals.”That may play a pivotal role in whether drugs from this class can be approved without long-term, “outcomes” studies that definitively show whether they can reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and deaths.New cholesterol management guidelines released last week by the AHA and American College of Cardiology only backed therapy with medicines that had demonstrated a reduction in heart risk, such as statins.That called into question whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would still be willing to approve drugs based on so-called surrogate end points, such as lowering LDL levels.An FDA official last week said the agency might be willing to approve the PCSK9 drugs without outcomes data if they did not show any unexpected toxicities.“I know with fairly good confidence that The FDA believes in LDL,” Koren said.“There’s tremendous excitement,” he said of the new class of drugs. “This is the biggest thing to happen to lipid treatment since statins.”"

Triglycerides went down about 9 percent and “good” HDL went up about 9 percent.Patients in the Osler extension study had previously completed participation in one of four 12-week Phase II studies of the drug.Serious adverse side effects occurred in 7.1 percent of patients treated with evolocumab and standard care compared with 6.3 percent for those who got standard therapy alone.Side effects such as elevated liver enzymes were similar - 1.8 percent for evolocumab versus 1.6 percent in the control group - and a measure of potential kidney problems was 1 percent compared with 1.9 percent.The serious side effects were not felt to be related to evolocumab, said Koren, of the Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida. He added that adverse heart events, such as heart attacks, were slightly higher in the standard of care patients.“It did wonderfully,” Koren said of the Amgen drug, “This gives us a much greater comfort level about possible safety signals.”That may play a pivotal role in whether drugs from this class can be approved without long-term, “outcomes” studies that definitively show whether they can reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and deaths.New cholesterol management guidelines released last week by the AHA and American College of Cardiology only backed therapy with medicines that had demonstrated a reduction in heart risk, such as statins.That called into question whether the U.S. Food and Drug Administration would still be willing to approve drugs based on so-called surrogate end points, such as lowering LDL levels.An FDA official last week said the agency might be willing to approve the PCSK9 drugs without outcomes data if they did not show any unexpected toxicities.“I know with fairly good confidence that The FDA believes in LDL,” Koren said.“There’s tremendous excitement,” he said of the new class of drugs. “This is the biggest thing to happen to lipid treatment since statins.”"
2013-11-22,"Sanofi, Regeneron arthritis drug meets goals in Phase 3 trial",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0J70UL20131122,"* Trial combined sarilumab and methotrexate* Sarilumab met all three co-primary endpoints* Most reported adverse events were infectionsPARIS, Nov 22 (Reuters) - An experimental drug for rheumatoid arthritis developed by French drugmaker Sanofi and Regeneron, when combined with methotrexate, improved symptoms and physical function and slowed progression of the disease in a late-stage clinical trial.Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system mistakenly attacks healthy tissue, causing inflammation and pain in the joints.Sanofi and Regeneron’s drug, called sarilumab, is an injectable antibody that works by blocking an inflammation-causing protein called interleukin 6. It is similar to Actemra, Roche’s fast-growing treatment approved in 2010.The success of the trial pushes the new drug one step closer to the production line, although it still to pass further long-term trials and the approval process in particular markets.The 52 week SARIL-RA-MOBILITY Phase 3 trial enrolled some 1,200 patients with active, moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis, who have not benefited from or been able to tolerate the standard oral treatment, methotrexate, whose side effects can include nausea and liver damage.Patients given a 200 mg dose of sarilumab every other week on top of methotrexate saw a 66 percent improvement in signs and symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis after six months, Sanofi and Regeneron said in a statement on Friday.Those given a 150 mg dose saw a 58 percent improvement, while those given a placebo alongside methotrexate saw a 33 percent improvement.Sarilumab met the other two primary endpoints of the study, improving physical function at week 16 and inhibiting progression of joint damage after one year, the companies said.Infections were the most frequently reported adverse side effects, as well as increases in “bad” LDL cholesterol and transaminases, they added.Sarilumab, alongside cholesterol drug alirocumab, is one of the promising products Sanofi is developing under its partnership with U.S. biotech Regeneron to offset the loss of patents on once top-selling drugs like blood thinner Plavix."
2013-11-22,Bayer receives new approval for Eylea eye treatment in Japan,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0J711T20131122,"FRANKFURT, Nov 22 (Reuters) - Bayer HealthCare has received approval from Japan’s Ministry of Health to treat macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) with its Eylea eye medication, the company said on Friday.“The additional approval of Eylea in Japan for the treatment of macular edema secondary to CRVO is great news for patients in Japan suffering from this potentially sight-threatening eye condition,” said Kemal Malik, member of the Bayer HealthCare Executive Committee and head of global development.Eylea, which treats age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the most common cause of blindness in the elderly - has been grabbing market share from rivals such as Roche AG’s Lucentis since its launch in late 2011.Bayer HealthCare and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc are collaborating on the global development of Eylea.Regeneron maintains exclusive U.S. rights, while Bayer HealthCare licensed the exclusive marketing rights outside the United States, where the companies share equally the profits from sales of Eylea, except for in Japan where Regeneron receives a royalty on net sales."
2013-11-28,Bayer submits Eylea for new indication in Japan,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSWEB00EYN20131128,"FRANKFURT, Nov 28 (Reuters) - Bayer has submitted its Eylea eye medication, co-developed with Regeneron, for approval in Japan to treat Myopic Choroidal Neovascularization (myopic CNV), a cause of blindness.In Japan, pathologic myopia and the associated myopic CNV is one of the most common causes of blindness, Bayer said.Eylea, which also treats age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the most common cause of blindness in the elderly - has been grabbing market share from rivals such as Roche AG’s Lucentis since its launch in late 2011."
2013-12-03,Ohr aims big with eye drop to rival blockbusters,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N0H13P120131203,"* Ohr seeks to follow commercial success of Regeneron, Roche* Eye drop could complement competitors’ injection therapies* Millions of Americans affected by wet age-related macular degeneration* Interim analysis of mid-stage trial data expected in 2014By Esha DeyDec 3 (Reuters) - Patients who are being treated for a leading cause of blindness among the elderly might be able to scale back on eye injections if trials confirm the potential of an eye drop being developed by a small New York-based company.Ohr Pharmaceutical Inc’s Squalamine drug - an eye drop, as opposed to the injection therapies sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Roche Holdings - doesn’t necessarily need to outsell its formidable competitors.Simply proving that the drop can be used as a complementary treatment to Regeneron’s Eylea or Roche’s Lucentis could be enough to ensure commercial success for Ohr in treating wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD).The main challenge will be to demonstrate Squalamine’s ability to travel to the back of the eye and stay there long enough to be absorbed. A mid-stage clinical trial is under way.Ohr Pharmaceutical, backed by Baltimore and New York investors, was formed in August 2009. Within a month, it bought the rights to Squalamine for $200,000 from a trust set up to monetize the assets of now-defunct drug developer Genaera Corp.The company’s stock has doubled in the last year but, with a market capitalization of about $160 million, Ohr is a minnow alongside its competitors in the lucrative market to treat AMD.Regeneron’s Eylea drug, approved in November 2011, has transformed a relatively obscure biotech firm to a company worth nearly $30 billion today. In 2012, its first full year in the market, Eylea generated $838 million in sales.Roche’s drug, Lucentis, which is used to treat AMD and two other eye diseases, had sales of $1.5 billion in the United States last year.AMD affects 1.8 million Americans aged 40 and above, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.With millions more at “substantial risk” of developing the condition, the number of patients could reach nearly 3 million in 2020, it says.AMD is a chronic condition that requires visually impaired patients to make monthly visits to the clinic.This is where Squalamine comes in. The eye drop is being tested to determine whether it can reduce the frequency of eye injections needed after an initial dose of Lucentis.Neil Bressler, chief of the retina division at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins Medicine in Baltimore, said patients using Eylea or Lucentis required an average of seven injections during their first year of treatment and five or six in the second year.“Even if you reduce those 12 or 13 injections to nine or 10, and if it is just a drop, then the safety and the ease is very, very good,” said Bressler, an independent observer who has no affiliation with Ohr.Regeneron and Roche declined to comment for this article.‘TRANSFORMATIVE’Interim analysis of data from the mid-stage trial is expected in the second quarter of 2014.Jonathan Aschoff, analyst at New York-based investment bank Brean Capital LLC, said he believed the data could be “transformative”.The only analyst listed by Thomson Reuters as covering Ohr, Aschoff has a target of $21 on the stock - more than two-and-a-half times its closing price of $7.98 on the Nasdaq on Monday.He estimated peak Squalamine sales in excess of $1 billion a year by 2020, assuming an annual price of $4,000 for the eye drop as a complementary treatment to - not a replacement for - injections.While extremely effective, Lucentis and Eylea - biotech drugs, as opposed to Ohr’s chemical-based pharmaceutical drug - are relatively expensive; Lucentis costs about $2,000 per injection and Eylea about $1,850.If Squalamine is proven to be effective, its lower price would make it an attractive proposition for patients, insurers and austere governments.“Complete replacement (for injections) is completely unnecessary for Ohr’s success,” said Aschoff. “Just look at how well Eylea is doing with reduction of injection frequency as its main thrust.”Like Eylea and Lucentis, Squalamine targets a specific protein, VEGF, or vascular endothelial growth factor, in order to block the formation and growth of new blood vessels in the eye. It also targets other factors behind blood vessel growth.The biggest questions to date over its effectiveness center on the drug’s ability to travel behind the eye. Unlike everyday cleansing eye drops, which work on the front of the eye, Squalamine requires absorption at the back.Genaera, Squalamine’s former owner, tested the drug intravenously in successful early trials. In eye-drop form, it has been tested on rabbits, also with successful results.Ohr Chief Executive Irach Taraporewala said the drug’s chemical composition would “allow the molecule, once it got to the back of the eye, to stay there long enough to potentially allow for once- or twice-a-day delivery.”The next set of trial data will be key for the investors behind Ohr, including 7.1 percent-owner AIGH Investment Partners, a Baltimore-based investment firm founded by Ohr director Orin Hirschman.If the results are good, Aschoff said it might eventually make sense for Ohr, which is also developing a treatment for cancer cachexia, a severe wasting disorder, to sell itself or Squalamine to a bigger competitor.“(The acquirer) could buy it to sit on it, and not develop it, to save their injectable franchise,” he said. “Or they could buy it to develop it - and see whichever one brings in the most revenue.”"
2013-12-06,Novartis aims to show strength with muscle wasting drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE9B50KF20131206,"BASEL (Reuters) - Fifteen years ago Ian Parkhill was diagnosed with a rare muscle-wasting disease that gradually robbed him of the strength in his thighs.Now, he struggles to walk. The waning muscle in his arms will soon hinder his ability to pull himself out of a chair, he fears, and simple tasks such as holding a pen are increasingly difficult as the dexterity in his fingers declines.“The only sort of grip I have is between the thumb and the palm,” said 81-year-old Parkhill, a former electrical engineer, who lives in Droitwich, England. “If I put a pencil on a flat surface, I can’t pick it up. I’ve got to use both hands.”Parkhill’s rare condition has, to date, gained little attention from drugmakers - but that is starting to change.Big Pharma is focusing a lot more these days on drugs for rare diseases like Parkhill’s - and the sky-high prices they can command - and some are also eying the potential of addressing related muscle problems behind a range of more common diseases.Sporadic Inclusion Body Myositis (sIBM) is the most common muscle-wasting disease in the over 50s, yet its exact cause remains unknown and there are no approved drugs to treat it.Although sIBM affects no more than 71 people per million, Swiss drugmaker Novartis is developing a treatment that stimulates muscle growth in sufferers.It is betting that the drug, known as bimagrumab or BYM338 and developed with German biotech company MorphoSys, might help combat muscle loss associated with conditions like cancer and chronic lung disease that affect millions of people.It could even be beneficial for patients recovering from injury or an operation, and the drugmaker is currently conducting a Phase II trial for hip fracture recovery.Novartis is not the only pharmaceutical firm working on muscle-building treatments. But it is heading the field in sIBM with BYM338, which was granted breakthrough therapy status from U.S. health regulators in August and is entering late-stage trials. It expects to file for approval in 2016.Eli Lily is coming up close behind with two mid-stage studies for its drug LY2495655 as a treatment for muscle weakness and muscular atrophy.Meanwhile, Regeneron and Sanofi have a drug in early stage development as a treatment for sarcopenia, the muscle loss associated with aging.Still, developing medicines for muscle disorders is not without risk. In August GTx’s experimental drug to treat muscle-wasting in cancer patients failed in key trials.Novartis recently completed a proof of concept study for BYM338, which found that eight weeks after a single infusion of the medicine, patients’ muscle volume increased by 5 percent - the kind of muscle growth normally seen after two months of intensive exercise.While those statistics offer hope for patients suffering from sIBM, the drug - which is named after Bhima, a character in the Hindu epic Mahabharata renowned for his strength - has rung alarm bells at the World Anti Doping Agency (WADA).WADA’s list of banned substances includes all agents that modify the function of myostatin - a protein regulating muscle growth.Novartis global head of development Tim Wright played down the risk that unscrupulous athletes might use the drug as a quick way to bulk up.“We’ve already developed a very, very sensitive assay for this and we’ve been in communication with the World Health Organization and WADA, so we don’t anticipate any significant issue with this,” he told Reuters in an interview at Novartis’ Basel headquarters.Because the drug is a biologic medicine with a long half life, it should be possible to detect if it has been used in recent months, he said.Phil Watson, a lecturer in sports nutrition at the University of Loughborough, said Novartis’ drug could be attractive for athletes that may have lost muscle mass due to injury or a long period of inactivity. But he noted that bigger muscles do not always improve athletic performance.“It would seem this type of treatment would be most attractive to strength and power athletes, but there does become a trade off at some point,” he said. “There is a point at which carrying too much muscle can become detrimental.”The drug, which is administered intravenously, works by targeting a pathway known as Activin RIIb that regulates muscle growth. By blocking the pathway, the drug allows the muscle cell to respond to other stimuli such as exercise, and grow.Novartis believes it is too early to speculate on the potential market size for BYM338, but analysts at Jefferies estimate peak sales for the drug of $300 million in sIBM.Pedro Machado, a senior clinical research associate at the MRC Centre for Neuromuscular Diseases at University College London (UCL) described Novartis’ approach as promising.But he said it needed to be determined whether increasing muscle volumes will actually translate into improved muscle strength and performance, as well as whether there are any long-term side effects."
2013-12-19,Sanofi to tap ACC registry for cardiovascular clinical trial,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0JY1AP20131219,"PARIS, Dec 19 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi and its U.S. partner Regeneron are collaborating with the American College of Cardiology (ACC) to identify patients for clinical trials on alirocumab, their new cholesterol treatment and potential blockbuster.Under this agreement, the ACC will use its expertise in clinical research and its extensive patient registries to identify appropriate candidates for a cardiovascular outcomes clinical trial, Sanofi said in a statement on Thursday.This is the first time that the ACC’s “Pinnacle” registry will be used for clinical trial recruitment, and Sanofi hopes accessing its millions of patient records will help it fully enrol the trial, which seeks some 18,000 patients who recently suffered an acute coronary syndrome.Alirocumab is an injectable drug from a promising new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors that is also being developed by Amgen Inc and other drugmakers. It has been touted by industry analysts as a potential blockbuster that could reap annual sales of over $3 billion.PCSK9 drugs are mainly aimed at the millions of people who either cannot tolerate statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor or AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor or who cannot get their cholesterol levels under control with statins alone.In the first of a dozen late-stage trials, alirocumab cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol almost in half. The drug’s ultimate success will depend on longer-term studies, some of which will only give results around 2018. But Sanofi and Regeneron are hoping positive earlier data could get the drug approved for some patients before then."

2013-2-05,Sanofi says Zaltrap approved in Europe for bowel cancer,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE91406Z20130205,"PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi said on Tuesday that its Zaltrap drug had been approved for marketing in the European Union to treat advanced bowel cancer.The approval follows a recommendation from the European Medicines Agency in November based on a late-stage study of the drug that showed significant improvement in survival among patients with colon cancer.Zaltrap, approved in the U.S. in August 2012, is among the new products Sanofi is relying on to restore growth after the loss of several blockbuster drugs to generic competitition.But CM-CIC analyst Arsene Guekam expects the drug, co-developed with U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron, will remain a niche product for Sanofi.Guekam is forecasting peak sales of 300 million euros ($406 million) a year since Zaltrap will compete against established medicines like Roche’s Avastin and Erbitux, sold by German drugmaker Merck, as a second-line treatment for advanced bowel cancer.Zaltrap is also unlikely to be used to treat other types of tumours, after it failed studies in prostate, lung and pancreatic cancer.Sanofi shares, which have risen around 26 percent in the last twelve months, were trading 1.7 percent at 70.85 euros at 5.16 EST, and were the leading gainer on the benchmark CAC40 index, up 0.5 percent."
2013-2-07,Amgen biosimilar push takes aim at blockbusters,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE91612E20130207,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Amgen Inc said it expects generic versions of biotech drugs, known as biosimilars, to be a multibillion-dollar opportunity for the company and has targeted some of the industry’s biggest sellers, including the main rivals for its own blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel.The company on Thursday also said that between this year and 2016 it will have key late-stage data from eight experimental medicines.Amgen Chief Executive Robert Bradway, at a meeting in New York to update analysts and investors on business strategy, said the company plans to launch six biosimilars beginning in 2017 - four cancer drugs and the two Enbrel rivals - Abbvie’s Humira and Remicade, which is sold by Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co Inc.It also plans to launch biosimilar versions of Roche Holding AG’s multibillion-dollar cancer drugs Avastin, Herceptin and Rituxan, as well as Eli Lilly and Co’s Erbitux.“They went after six of the largest biologics in the market with a total of over $40 billion in revenue. But they laid out this big goal without a lot of specifics,” said RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee, who is looking for details on pricing and the types of studies the company will conduct to bring its biosimilars to market.“Certainly biosimilars are an important driver to 2017 and beyond, but we’d like more specifics.”The world’s largest biotechnology company believes it has a unique capability to become a major player in biosimilars once U.S. health regulators finalize the approval pathway for such drugs, which are not identical matches of the branded medicines in the manner of traditional generic versions of pills.“The company is clearly straddling two business opportunities that sometimes seem in conflict with each other - a defender of the innovative products and a participant in biosimilar products. That tension is going to continue to be difficult for them to manage,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges.Amgen research chief Sean Harper said the company was viewing biosimilars as more of a global opportunity. “We feel that these medicines are very valuable and in many parts of the world patients have no access to them because they are so expensive,” he said.Enbrel, which had 2012 sales of $4.2 billion and has patent protection into 2028, will become more profitable at the end of the year, when a profit-sharing arrangement with Pfizer becomes a royalty payment. That will result in an operating profit of about $800 million in 2014, the company said.Amgen raised its 2013 earnings forecast to account for a tax credit due to federal settlements for prior years. Amgen now expects adjusted 2013 earnings of $7.05 to $7.35 per share, and said it would record the credit in the first quarter.The company last month forecast earnings per share of $6.85 to $7.15. The 2013 revenue forecast remains unchanged at $17.8 billion to $18.2 billion.Chief Financial Officer Jonathan Peacock said Amgen will continue to return more than 60 percent of adjusted net profit to shareholders through dividend increases and some share buybacks.The company also said it plans to continue to pursue strategic acquisitions, and that it expects to expand its business into major Asian markets in 2015 and 2016. “The fact that Amgen was not present in Japan and China was a noticeable gap,” Bradway said.“They are a bellwether for the industry,” Bernstein’s Porges said of Amgen. “The real focus is getting into lower-priced markets and lower-priced products and driving business through cost efficiencies. That tells you something about the state of the industry.”Harper provided an update of the company’s drugs in development in several therapeutic areas, including medicines for a variety of cancers, heart disease, osteoporosis and psoriasis.The cancer drugs include trebananib for ovarian cancer with key late-stage data expected in mid-2013, and rilotumumab for advanced gastric cancer, a huge unmet need in China and emerging markets. Late-stage data on that drug is due in 2016, just about the time the company sees making a move into China.Amgen’s highest-profile drug in development is AMG-145, its cholesterol fighter from a closely watched new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors meant to be taken by patients unable to tolerate statins, like Lipitor and Zocor, or those who fail to reach LDL goals with statins. In earlier clinical trials, PCSK9 inhibitors have dramatically reduced bad LDL cholesterol.The class, which blocks a protein that prevents the body from removing artery-clogging LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream, is a hot area of research being pursued by several companies, including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi SA, and Pfizer.Amgen has begun a Phase III AMG-145 program with more than 26,000 patients over seven studies. It expects to have initial Phase III data in early 2014, and estimates having results in 2018 from a large so-called outcomes study to demonstrate that it can reduce heart attacks and strokes.Harper said he was confident that AMG-145 would show “a decrease in cardiovascular outcomes”. He added: “This will be the biggest study Amgen has ever done.”He expressed similar confidence that romosozumab for post-menopausal osteoporosis would prevent fractures in a pair of late-stage trials of about 6,000 women, with data expected in 2015.Tony Hooper, Amgen’s head of global commercial operations, said AMG-145 would compete in a market estimated to be 17 million high-risk patients.Amgen shares were off 96 cents, or 1.1 percent, at $85.63 on Nasdaq, on a generally down day for the broader market."
2013-2-11,Sanofi boosting stake in Regeneron,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE91A0MW20130211,"(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi SA SASY.PA is buying more shares in U.S. biotech company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O, its partner in the development of potential blockbuster treatments for cholesterol and rheumatoid arthritis.Sanofi’s plans, disclosed by the companies in separate statements on Monday, boosted both companies’ shares.Sanofi controls 16.7 percent of Regeneron, or 15.82 million shares, according to Reuters data. Sanofi said in an email that it has the right to raise the stake to as much as 30 percent under its decade-long partnership with Regeneron.“We are very happy with the relationship with Regeneron, but we needed this technical filing to get freedom to operate,” the company said. Sanofi disclosed its plans to buy Regeron shares on the open market in a filing with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.Peter Dworkin, a spokesman for Regeneron, said that under terms of their partnership, Sanofi is not allowed to increase its stake beyond 30 percent until five years after the planned 2017 conclusion of their collaboration.“The 30 percent limit they can acquire without our permission is in force and will remain in force” until 2022, Dworkin said.Under the partnership, Sanofi and Regeneron have agreed to equally split U.S. profits from medicines they develop together.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer has said his company enjoys “unprecedented” favorable financial terms from the partnership because Sanofi funds 100 percent of expenses to develop their drugs.“I think this is a sign that they (Sanofi) are taking more interest in the company,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas. “I don’t think investors should immediately conclude that an acquisition is coming soon.”Morningstar analyst Lauren Migliore said it was unclear whether Sanofi was merely boosting its stake in Regeneron or eventually aimed for a controlling stake or outright ownership.“I wouldn’t want to speculate either way,” Migliore said. “But Regeneron has a great drug portfolio and technology and a very strong partnership with Sanofi, so a merger would make sense.”She also said a merger would be costly because acquirers typically have to pay premiums of 30 to 100 percent for shares of attractive biotechs, and Regeneron’s stock has risen more than fourfold in the past two years. The company’s valuation has soared on booming sales of Eylea, a treatment for macular degeneration, and greater awareness on Wall Street of its promising experimental drugs.Regeneron shares were up 2.8 percent in afternoon trading. Shares of Sanofi, whose earnings have been hurt by generic competition for its Plavix blood-clot preventer, rose 3.4 percent in Paris.Regeneron is best known for Eylea, co-marketed with Bayer AG BAYGn.DE. The drug is expected to garner sales this year of up to $1.3 billion.U.S. regulators last summer approved Regeneron’s Zaltrap treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, co-developed with Sanofi. Analysts believe the drug could eventually bring in annual sales of $400 million.Investors are closely watching the Regeneron-Sanofi cholesterol drug, which is in late-stage trials. The drug has slashed levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by 60 percent through a new mechanism - blocking a protein called PCSK9.Another drug from the partnership, which blocks an inflammation-causing protein called interleukin 6, is being tested against rheumatoid arthritis. Some analysts believe the cholesterol and arthritis drugs could each become $1 billion-a-year sellers if approved.The expiration of Sanofi’s patent on Plavix, once the world’s second-best-selling prescription drug, is expected to slice around $1.1 billion off earnings in the first half of 2013, Sanofi said last week. The company aims to have 18 new drugs on the market by 2015."

2013-2-11,Sanofi boosting stake in U.S. biotech Regeneron,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0BB3IC20130211,"* Sanofi to buy Regeneron shares on open market* Regeneron shares rise 2.8 percent* Sanofi up 3.4 percent (Adds analyst and company comments, background on partnership, byline)Feb 11 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi SA is buying more shares in U.S. biotech company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, its partner in the development of potential blockbuster treatments for cholesterol and rheumatoid arthritis.Sanofi’s plans, disclosed by the companies in separate statements on Monday, boosted both companies’ shares.Sanofi controls 16.7 percent of Regeneron, or 15.82 million shares, according to Reuters data. Sanofi said in an email that it has the right to raise the stake to as much as 30 percent under its decade-long partnership with Regeneron.“We are very happy with the relationship with Regeneron, but we needed this technical filing to get freedom to operate,” the company said. Sanofi disclosed its plans to buy Regeron shares on the open market in a filing with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission.Peter Dworkin, a spokesman for Regeneron, said that under terms of their partnership, Sanofi is not allowed to increase its stake beyond 30 percent until five years after the planned 2017 conclusion of their collaboration.“The 30 percent limit they can acquire without our permission is in force and will remain in force” until 2022, Dworkin said.Under the partnership, Sanofi and Regeneron have agreed to equally split U.S. profits from medicines they develop together.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer has said his company enjoys “unprecedented” favorable financial terms from the partnership because Sanofi funds 100 percent of expenses to develop their drugs.“I think this is a sign that they (Sanofi) are taking more interest in the company,” said Deutsche Bank analyst Robyn Karnauskas. “I don’t think investors should immediately conclude that an acquisition is coming soon.”Morningstar analyst Lauren Migliore said it was unclear whether Sanofi was merely boosting its stake in Regeneron or eventually aimed for a controlling stake or outright ownership.“I wouldn’t want to speculate either way,” Migliore said. “But Regeneron has a great drug portfolio and technology and a very strong partnership with Sanofi, so a merger would make sense.”She also said a merger would be costly because acquirers typically have to pay premiums of 30 to 100 percent for shares of attractive biotechs, and Regeneron’s stock has risen more than fourfold in the past two years. The company’s valuation has soared on booming sales of Eylea, a treatment for macular degeneration, and greater awareness on Wall Street of its promising experimental drugs.Regeneron shares were up 2.8 percent in afternoon trading. Shares of Sanofi, whose earnings have been hurt by generic competition for its Plavix blood-clot preventer, rose 3.4 percent in Paris.Regeneron is best known for Eylea, co-marketed with Bayer AG . The drug is expected to garner sales this year of up to $1.3 billion.U.S. regulators last summer approved Regeneron’s Zaltrap treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, co-developed with Sanofi. Analysts believe the drug could eventually bring in annual sales of $400 million.Investors are closely watching the Regeneron-Sanofi cholesterol drug, which is in late-stage trials. The drug has slashed levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by 60 percent through a new mechanism - blocking a protein called PCSK9.Another drug from the partnership, which blocks an inflammation-causing protein called interleukin 6, is being tested against rheumatoid arthritis. Some analysts believe the cholesterol and arthritis drugs could each become $1 billion-a-year sellers if approved.The expiration of Sanofi’s patent on Plavix, once the world’s second-best-selling prescription drug, is expected to slice around $1.1 billion off earnings in the first half of 2013, Sanofi said last week. The company aims to have 18 new drugs on the market by 2015."

Eylea sales were $244 million in the previous quarter.The biotechnology company reaffirmed the 2013 Eylea sales forecast of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion it issued in January.But investors accustomed to Regeneron consistently raising Eylea forecasts sent the companies high flying shares, which have tripled over the past 14 months, down more than 3 percent.“Obviously Regeneron has been a fantastic performer driven by their macular degeneration drug Eylea,” said Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff.But he said the drug has already seen solid penetration into U.S. clinics and that investors were likely to see less of the company beating Eylea sales expectations and raising forecasts going forward.Eylea is sold by Germany's Bayer AG BAYGn.DE outside the United States.“Our partner Bayer HealthCare has begun to launch Eylea in Japan, Europe, Australia, and other regions, and we expect to see substantial sales growth through 2013 and beyond as pricing approvals are received,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in a statement.The company is also in late stage testing of Eylea for two other eye conditions that could further expand sales with eventual additional approvals.On an adjusted basis, Regeneron earned $1.22 per share, beating analysts’ average estimates of $1.10 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.It posted a fourth-quarter net profit of $470 million, or $4.08 per share, compared with a loss of $53.4 million, or 58 cents per share, a year earlier.Regeneron had preannounced its fourth-quarter results.“The one surprise was that the beat was driven by a one-time tax gain,” Tenthoff said.Total revenue for the quarter more than tripled to $414.6 million, topping Wall Street estimates of $392.6 million.The drug Zaltrap, which was approved in the United States in August to treat colorectal cancer, had sales of $23 million for its first full quarter.Regeneron shares were down $5.85, or 3.4 percent, at $164.50 in midday trading on Nasdaq."

Profit was $229.8 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, Allergan earned 98 cents per share. Analysts were expecting 96 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Global company sales rose 8 percent to $1.46 billion, above Wall Street’s average estimate of $1.44 billion.Sales of Botox, which is also approved for treating migraine headaches, overactive bladder and underarm sweating, rose 15 percent to $457.9 million.Allergan also forecast slightly weak earnings for the second quarter and the full year to reflect the impact of its MAP Pharmaceuticals acquisition earlier this year.It now expects 2013 adjusted earnings of $4.70 to $4.76 per share, compared to its prior outlook of $4.75 to $4.83.The company forecast a second-quarter profit of $1.18 to $1.20 per share, below analysts’ average estimate of $1.22."

2013-5-01,Allergan delays drug that would rival Regeneron\'s Eylea,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0DI28P20130501,"May 1 (Reuters) - Allergan Inc said approval of its Darpin eye drug could be delayed up to two years, providing a new boost to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc whose successful treatment, Eylea, stands to gain from a lack of new competition.Shares of Allergan, which makes wrinkle treatment Botox, fell 13.1 percent after the company said mid-stage trial results of Darpin did not warrant an immediate move into far larger late-stage trials. Regeneron shares closed up 10.3 percent.If eventually approved, Darpin would also compete with Roche Holding AG’s, Lucentis, to treat age-related macular degeneration - the most common form of blindness in the elderly.Adnan Butt, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said Darpin’s delay was “great news” for Regeneron. He noted that Wall Street had feared the Allergan drug might have a superior clinical profile to Eylea.“This gives Eylea even more time to become entrenched as the drug to beat,” Butt said.He estimates that each year of Darpin delay will translate into an upside of about $15 to $20 for Regeneron shares, now trading at about $240.Eylea, which was approved in November 2011, had sales last year of $838 million. Regeneron expects 2013 Eylea sales of $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion. Company officials would not comment on the setback for Allergan’s drug.Regeneron is expected to report first quarter results on Friday and could update its sales projections.Allergan Chief Executive David Pyott said on a conference call that a mid-stage trial of Darpin showed some product differentiation over Lucentis, but did not support directly moving to late-stage development.The company now plans to perform additional mid-stage trials to assess Darpin, which will delay its potential approval by one to two years.“There was a rush to ascribe a lot of value to Darpin and our view is that this is still very much an unproven asset with limited data,” Piper Jaffray analyst David Amsellem said.“The earliest it could get to market now is likely 2019,” Amsellem said. “If you couple that with the setback of the hair loss product, the late-stage pipeline for Allergan right now is really quite thin.”A mid-stage trial of Allergan’s hair loss treatment Bimatoprost Scalp also failed to provide sufficient efficacy to proceed to a late-stage study, further weighing on company shares.Regeneron in the past two years has vaulted seemingly out of nowhere to become one of the world’s biggest biotechnology companies, thanks largely to Eylea.The company has repeatedly raised its sales forecasts for the drug, which is injected into the eye, as it steadily steals market share from Lucentis.Some specialty pharmacies also use Roche’s Avastin cancer drug, which works the same way as Lucentis, but is far less expensive, when divided into smaller portions for treating macular degeneration.Roche has said that dividing Avastin through a procedure not closely monitored by health regulators, called compounding, could compromise its sterility.Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in a recent interview that sales of Eylea could jump sharply if potential rivals stumble, or if U.S. regulators clamp down on the compounding of Avastin for eye use.Moreover, he said some analysts believe Eylea sales could swell if it is approved for a new indication called diabetic macular edema now in late-stage trials. Lucentis is already approved for the condition.“So Eylea is a growth story unto itself, with lots of room to still grow,” Schleifer said.Allergan on Wednesday also posted a higher-than-expected quarterly profit, helped by strong sales of Botox.Net income for the first quarter fell to $12.5 million, or 4 cents per share, due to a loss of $259 million from discontinued operations. Profit was $229.8 million, or 74 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, Allergan earned 98 cents per share.

It had earlier projected $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion.Shares of Regeneron have nearly doubled in value over the past year.Eylea, which treats age-related macular degeneration (AMD) - the most common cause of blindness in the elderly -- has been swiftly grabbing market share from rivals such as Roche AG’s Lucentis since its launch in late 2011.In 2012, Regeneron raised its sales estimate for the year four times.The drug is also expected to benefit as Botox maker Allergan Inc said on Wednesday its drug Darpin, a potential Eylea competitor, could be delayed by up to two years.“With Darpin’s recent stumble, the most prominent competitive threat to the Eylea franchise has been largely removed,” Cowen & Co analyst Phil Nadeau said in a note to clients.Regeneron also strengthened its foothold in the eye care market with an agreement to acquire from partner Sanofi all rights to two antibodies that could potentially be used along with Eylea to treat AMD.Analysts said such a combination of drugs would be much better at treating the eyesight-robbing condition than Roche’s Lucentis or Avastin, a cancer drug.The latest deal with Sanofi includes an upfront payment of $20 million, and up to $45 million more in milestones.However, on a post-earnings call with analysts, Regeneron Chief Len Schleifer said a cut in Medicare reimbursement for Eylea due to sequestration could cause some physicians to shift to Avastin, used off-label to treat the same indication.The impact of such a shift is, however, likely to be small given the safety effects of using Avastin, RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt said.Earlier this year, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration reported multiple cases of serious eye infection from compounded or altered versions of Avastin used to treat macular degeneration.“Eylea is working in hard-to-treat patients who are not responding to Lucentis or Avastin, which keeps us confident about Eylea growth continuing,” Butt said.CEO Schleifer also cautioned that Eylea’s U.S. sales growth would be slower for the rest of this year as most of the sales now come from existing patients who have moved to a less frequent dosing.Leerink Swann analyst Joseph Schwartz said Regeneron may be more cautious now in its forecasts as more patients move to the less frequent regimen. Investors have become accustomed to more dramatic increases in the estimates, he added.Excluding one-time items, Regeneron earned $1.78 per share in the first quarter, well above analysts’ average estimate of 98 cents per share.Sales of Eylea, which the company co-owns with Bayer AG , rose 153 percent to $314 million in the quarter.Total revenue -- which includes collaboration revenue from Bayer and Sanofi -- rose 90 percent to $440 million, ahead of the average analyst estimate of $428.3 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Regeneron’s net profit rose to $99 million, or 90 cents per share, from $12 million, or 11 cents per share, a year earlier.

I think that has killed a lot of transactions that we have seen where discussions either started or pharma thought about approaching or maybe even did approach,” said Henry Gosebruch, managing director of healthcare M&A at JPMorgan Chase . He spoke at the Reuters Health Summit in New York.In some cases, a major drugmaker will identify a biotechnology target and watch it for years to determine the right time to make an offer. It may have balked at paying a high premium early on, and by the time it is ready to do a deal, the biotech company has become even more expensive, Gosebruch said.“I could think about four or five of those stories,” he said.For example, shares of Regeneron have risen more than 50 percent year-to-date, to the $260 range, on spectacular sales of its Eylea treatment for macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.Biotech stock valuations are skyrocketing even on the release of positive data around a drug. Biogen Idec’s stock has more than quadrupled over the past four years over promising data surrounding its Tecfidera drug for multiple sclerosis, which was approved just this year.With interest rates low and financing easily available, biotechnology companies realize they do not need to be bought in order to bankroll their clinical trials and marketing efforts, said Ercument Tokat, a partner and healthcare banker at New York-based investment bank Centerview Partners.“In the last few years what has changed quite dramatically is that mid-cap and large-cap biotechs have turned into acquirers,” Tokat said. “Most of the time in the past, if you were single-product biotech with a phase 3 drug, you were really waiting to be bought.”Biotech investors have also reacted positively when companies announced acquisitions, emboldening more industry CEOs to grow through M&A, bankers said.For example, Gilead paid about $11 billion in 2011 to acquire Pharmasset for its experimental Hepatitis C drug. Since that acquisition, Gilead’s stock has jumped more than 185 percent and is trading slightly above $53.Similarly, since buying Abraxis BioScience for its breast cancer drug Abraxane in June 2010, Celgene has seen its stock almost triple in value. It currently trades around $122 per share.“On the pharma side, it is a trickier question because a lot of Big Pharma investors are there for the dividend or buyback, there for the value, they’re there for steady cash flow and may be less willing to support risky transactions,” Gosebruch said.The rich valuations of biotechnology companies are not just staving off potential acquirers, but also activist investors who in the past have sought to shake up the operations of underperforming companies and attract takeovers by Big Pharma.“These stocks have doubled or tripled ... it is hard to make the case they’ve been underperforming,” Tokat said.Healthcare bankers expect a continued flow of smaller deals for both publicly traded and privately held drugmakers in the $1 billion to $5 billion range.“There are hundreds of private companies that could be good targets for big pharma,” Gosebruch said.Pharmaceutical companies, which have survived the worst of the patent cliffs and spent the last few years on cutting costs, are now looking externally for growth, but the days of huge pharma mergers are unlikely to make a comeback in the near future, bankers said.“The stars are not fully aligned,” Gosebruch said. “The overall confidence in the world is improving but it’s got a long way to go.

2013-5-20,Regeneron settles all pending litigation with Roche\'s Genentech,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0E138G20130520,"May 20 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said it settled all pending litigation with Roche Holding AG’s unit Genentech on the company’s eye drug, Eylea, and cancer drug, Zaltrap.Shares of Regeneron were up 1.8 percent in extended trading.Regeneron, which had agreed on Dec. 31, 2011 to make royalty and milestone payments to Genentech based on Eylea's U.S. sales, said on Monday the payment will now include worldwide sales of the eye drug. Bayer AG, which markets Eylea outside the United States, will share the payments.Regeneron and Sanofi SA’s units in the United States, which co-developed Zaltrap, will pay $19 million to Genentech when cumulative sales of the drug reach $200 million.They will also pay 4.5 percent on cumulative sales of $400 million to $1 billion and 6.5 percent on sales over $1 billion.Genentech had alleged that the active ingredients in both the drugs infringed its anti-VEGF technology patent."
2013-5-21,"Regeneron, Sanofi asthma drug seen as potential game changer",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE94K0I020130521,"(Reuters) - A new type of asthma drug meant to attack the underlying causes of the respiratory disease slashed episodes by 87 percent in a mid-stage trial, making it a potential game changer for patients with moderate to severe disease, researchers said on Tuesday.“Overall, these are the most exciting data we’ve seen in asthma in 20 years,” said Dr. Sally Wenzel, lead investigator for the 104-patient study of dupilumab, an injectable treatment being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi.The drug also met all its secondary goals, such as improving symptoms and lung function and reducing the need for standard drugs called beta agonists.Although far larger trials will be needed to confirm findings from the “proof of concept” study, researchers expressed optimism. They noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis, or severe eczema, an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments.Results of the 12-week asthma study are being presented on Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.The medicine, if approved, could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs.“We have been treating asthma with sort of Band-Aid therapies that didn’t get at the underlying causes,” Wenzel said in an interview, adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem.The drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).Wenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success.The trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated.Such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.All patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments, meaning medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as long-acting beta agonists. But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.Throughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.After the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.“By end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab,” Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.Wenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.Regeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.Dupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis. Larger studies are slated to begin later this year.Atopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.“This asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases,” George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s research chief, said in an interview.Trial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared “compelling” at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.But the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a “limited subpopulation of patients with asthma” because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.“We do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations,” the editorial said, including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils."

The size of the discounts offered on both drugs is commercially confidential.Eylea and Lucentis are both injected into the eye to counter wet AMD, which affects a tiny part of the retina at the back of the eye.NICE decides if drugs should be paid for on the state health service and its decisions are followed closely both by drug companies and health authorities in other countries. NICE said on Friday it expected to publish final guidance on Eylea in August 2013.Germany’s Bayer and U.S.-based Regeneron are collaborating on Eylea, with Regeneron maintaining exclusive rights in the United States and Bayer - which licensed the drug from its partner - marketing it elsewhere."

2013-6-03,New drugs trail many old ones in effectiveness against disease,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0EC1E720130603,"NEW YORK, June 3 (Reuters) - Despite the more than $50 billion that U.S. pharmaceutical companies have spent every year since the mid-2000s to discover new medications, drugmakers have barely improved on old standbys developed decades ago.Research published on Monday showed that the effectiveness of new drugs, as measured by comparing the response of patients on those treatments to those taking a placebo, has plummeted since the 1970s.While that is already unwelcome news to drug and biotech companies, the consequences for the pharmaceutical industry could get worse under President Barack Obama’s healthcare law.The law established an independent research institute to compare the effectiveness of different treatments for the same condition. That way, patients as well as private insurers and government programs such as Medicare can stop paying for less effective therapies. If the new analysis is correct, then “comparative effectiveness research” could conclude that older drugs, which are more likely to be generics, are better than pricey new brand names that deliver the most profits for drugmakers.Fears of a crisis in drug innovation have grown over the years. When the healthcare journal Prescrire in 2011 ranked new drugs, only 17 of the 984 developed since 2001 were deemed “a real advance” or better. And a survey of 184 expert physicians in 15 specialties published last month in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery showed the doctors were more likely to rate drugs more than a decade old as “transformative.”To be sure, drugs that completely change outcomes for patients continue to emerge. Gleevec, from Novartis, greatly extends life for leukemia patients, for instance. New antivirals such as Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals have doubled the cure rate in hepatitis C, and Eylea from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals is better than anything previously developed for macular degeneration.Because of those and other examples, “we believe that a lot continues to be accomplished in terms of yielding very, very positive results for patients, so there seems to be a disconnect between that and this paper,” said Randy Burkholder, deputy vice president of policy at the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) trade group.The new study in the journal Health Affairs examined 315 clinical trials that compared a drug to a placebo and were published in four of the world’s top medical journals (BMJ, Journal of the American Medical Association, Lancet and New England Journal of Medicine) from 1966 to 2010. The drugs targeted the full range of human ills, from cardiovascular disease and infections to cancer, mental disorders and respiratory illness.In the early years, drugs easily beat the placebo: They were, on average, 4.5 times as effective, where effectiveness means how well they lowered blood pressure, vanquished tumors, lifted depression or did whatever else they were intended to.But the trend line was inexorably downhill, found Dr Mark Olfson of Columbia University and statistician Steven Marcus of the University of Pennsylvania. By the 1980s drugs were less than four times better; by the 1990s, twice as good, and by the 2000s just 36 percent better than a placebo. Since older drugs were much superior to placebo and newer ones only slightly so, that means older drugs were generally more effective than newer ones.“Their results are pretty compelling,” said Dr Aaron Kesselheim of Harvard Medical School, who helped conduct the survey of physicians on “transformative” drugs but was not involved in this study. “It does appear that things are headed in the same direction, with newer drugs having relatively less efficacy.”Experts disagree on why that should be, but suspicions range from the U.S. regulatory process to basic biology.“It may be that the drug discoveries based on low-hanging fruit were made long ago,” said Olfson, as with discoveries based on the most basic or easily targeted causes of high blood pressure. In that case, older drugs based on those targets would pack a bigger punch than newer ones that target less-central causes of disease.Or, it could be that the patients who volunteer for clinical trials have gotten harder to treat. In many cases, people volunteer because existing drugs are not helping their cancer, schizophrenia or other condition, Olfson said, “and may have forms of the disease where it’s harder for a drug to demonstrate a benefit.”Another explanation could be that the scientific quality of clinical trials has improved over the decades, as the Health Affairs analysis found. Human studies in the 2000s were more likely than those in the 1960s to enroll hundreds of patients rather than dozens.“It may be that the compounds aren’t getting less effective but that they’re getting looked at more carefully,” said Dr Harold Sox of the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice and former editor of the Annals of Internal Medicine.‘SOMETHING REAL IS GOING ON’While experts agree that tougher trials and similar factors explain some of the decline in drugs’ reported effectiveness, “something real is going on here,” said Olfson. “Physicians keep saying that many of the new things just aren’t working as well,” and therefore prescribe antidepressant drugs called tricyclics (developed in the 1950s) instead of SSRIs (from the 1980s), or diuretics (invented in the 1920s) for high blood pressure instead of newer anti-hypertensives.Whatever the reason for many new drugs packing less punch than old ones, that will not keep them from reaching patients.“The way the drug regulatory system is set up, even if you have just a small advance, if you market it right it can be very profitable,” said Kesselheim.Critics of the high prices of drugs that are only marginally (if at all) more effective than older, cheaper, often generic medications hope that head-to-head studies will persuade more physicians to stop prescribing expensive but less effective drugs. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 - “Obamacare” - established the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute (PCORI) to conduct such comparative effectiveness research.The drug industry says it isn’t worried. “Our sector is not concerned about objective, high-quality patient-centered comparative effectiveness research,” said PhRMA’s Burkholder. “We believe the substantial value of our products will continue to be demonstrated.”"

2013-6-20,UK cost agency turns down Sanofi bowel cancer drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE95J1BN20130620,"LONDON (Reuters) - Sanofi’s new bowel cancer drug Zaltrap is not worth using on Britain’s state health service given its high price, the country’s healthcare cost watchdog said on Friday.The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) said the medicine was clinically effective but it could not be considered a cost-effective use of National Health Service resources - even though Sanofi offered a discount.The draft decision, which is now open to consultation, will be a disappointment for the French drugmaker and its U.S. biotech partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. It is not a complete surprise, however, since NICE previously turned down a similar medicine, Avastin, made by Roche.Zaltrap, like Avastin but through a different approach, blocks a protein called VEGF that tumors employ to create blood vessels that provide them with nutrients.The cost of Zaltrap has also been in the spotlight in the United States, after doctors at New York’s Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center decided last November not to use the $11,000-a-month drug. Sanofi, according to the hospital, responded by offering it to all health providers at a 50 percent discount to the wholesale price."
2013-7-12,Alnylam bets on \'gene silencing\' to woo biotech investors,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE96B0JV20130712,"(Reuters) - A radical new treatment for genetic disorders has catapulted Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc into the crosshairs of investors seeking the next breakthrough name in biotechnology.The challenge for the Cambridge, Massachusetts-based company now is to prove that its ‘gene silencing’ technology can make the leap from the laboratory to the doctor’s office and eclipse an alternative therapy already in use.Investors, for now, are betting that it will. A steady drip of positive trial data has helped to triple Alnylam’s market value to more than $2.7 billion in the space of 12 months. Eight of the nine analysts covering the stock rate it “buy” or above.For some, gene silencing could be a revolutionary treatment. It works by ‘switching off’ the genes that cause disease, while its potency derives from an ability to reproduce itself - meaning a small dose can eliminate multiple targets.“People know this mechanism works in a laboratory, but in humans there is the challenge of delivering it to the appropriate cell,” said Marko Kozul, analyst at Leerink Swann, an investment bank that specializes in healthcare.“The question isn’t one of mechanism. It’s one of delivery.”Alnylam is testing its technology in conditions as varied as liver cancer, respiratory tract infections, hemophilia and high cholesterol.Its most advanced drug candidate, however, is a treatment for amyloidosis, a rare condition caused by mutations in the gene that produces the protein transthyterin (TTR). The mutation leads to an abnormal build-up of proteins in various organs.On Thursday, Alnylam’s stock rose 16 percent after the company said an early-stage trial of the therapy - known as ALN-TTR - suppressed production of the protein. The drug was administered subcutaneously, under the skin, ensuring its slow release.Chief Executive John Maraganore told Reuters in an interview that Alnylam was in talks with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and wants to establish late-stage trial goals which, if negotiated, would offer a more streamlined path to approval.“There is recognition by the authorities of the significant unmet need in this disease,” said Maraganore, who invented and led development of anti-clotting medicine Angiomax in a previous job at Biogen Idec Inc.Alnylam is not alone in fighting genetic disease. In terms of getting a drug to market, the company is playing catch-up.Often compared with Alnylam because of its focus on gene-based drug technologies, Isis Pharmaceuticals Inc had its drug, Kynamro, approved by the FDA in January. Its stock price has more than doubled in the last year.Kynamro is a treatment for a rare genetic disorder causing dangerously high levels of ‘bad’ LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol. Isis is also developing a different drug to treat amyloidosis with its partner, GlaxoSmithKline Plc.Isis uses a different technology to tackle genetic illness. Known as antisense, it helps a drug bind to a specific gene in order to interrupt the production of disease-causing proteins.Alnylam’s RNA interference, or RNAi - the scientific term for gene silencing - works by turning off so-called messenger RNAs, or mRNAs, which signal the production of similar proteins.“One molecule of RNA can lead to silencing or destruction of many RNA targets,” said Daniel Anderson, a scientist based at the Harvard-MIT Division of Health Sciences and Technology, who holds a research grant from Alnylam.“It recycles, basically, and keeps going. Perhaps there is some debate in the field, but there is an argument to be made that RNAi-based drugs do have the potential for increased potency and longevity.”They might be safer, too. Edward Tenthoff, analyst at investment bank Piper Jaffray, said that RNAi-based drugs can be administered in comparatively small doses.To date, the problem has been in the delivery. Alnylam’s gene silencing therapies, when tested intravenously, have been degraded by enzymes in the blood before they could act.Analysts say that, if this hurdle can be overcome, the treatment could be more effective than antisense. The latest data on subcutaneous delivery removed some of the uncertainty.Alnylam said on Thursday that the subcutaneous GalNAc-siRNA conjugate delivery platform would now be the primary approach for development of its RNAi pipeline.It is partnering with companies such as Arrowhead Research Corp and Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp to explore delivery techniques.Tenthoff estimated that the subcutaneous version of the drug could bring in as much as $4.1 billion in 2020. He estimated it would reach market in 2018.‘EXCITING’ PIPELINEAlnylam has $450 million in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities - but no plans for deals.“Boy! We have not seen anything in the outside world that even comes close to being as exciting as investing in our pipeline,” Maraganore said. “We are going to stay pretty focused on organic growth.”A year ago, the company’s stock was worth $13.12. Even before Thursday’s spike, shares were trading at three times that level.Maraganore, 50, said he hopes Alnylam can follow the same upward trajectory as market darlings Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.“Those are two companies that have built enormous value by virtue of commercializing breakthrough medicines with significant retention of product rights and using partnerships,” he said.Regeneron, for example, has risen from relative obscurity to a $23 billion company on the strength of its eye drug, Eylea.If it can silence genes enough to treat just a few diseases, Alnylam holds similar prospects, said Kozul at Leerink Swann.“Alnylam could become a multi-billion-dollar market-cap company even if it only targets liver-mediated disease.”"
2013-7-19,DEALTALK-Biotech takeover interest more fad than fashion,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0FO1OD20130719,"July 19 (Reuters) - Investors betting on a wave of big biotechnology deals following Amgen Inc’s $10 billion bid for Onyx Pharmaceuticals Inc may well be disappointed.Shares of companies like BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc , Seattle Genetics Inc, Ariad Pharmaceuticals Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc and Clovis Oncology Inc have all rallied on news late last month that Onyx had spurned Amgen’s offer.Experts in the field agree that the bid, rejected as inadequate by Onyx, confirms a healthy interest in small to mid-cap biotechs, but said it does not raise the likelihood of more deals in the already hot sector.A major reason is that valuations have gotten very rich, with the Nasdaq Biotech Index up more than 43 percent in the past 12 months. Some of the companies concerned also have existing drug development agreements with larger drugmakers, making takeovers more complicated and potentially more expensive.“People are being more disciplined and saying, yes I wish I would have bought it for $2 billion a few years ago, but I’m not going to turn that regret into overpayment now,” said an M&A lawyer familiar with the industry.The sector-wide rally, while making it more difficult for larger companies to put together an economically feasible deal, has also eased the pressure on smaller companies who may not be interested in being acquired.Amgen’s takeover interest in Onyx was followed by news last week that Switzerland’s Roche Holding AG sought financing to mount a bid for Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc , sending the smaller company’s shares up 10 percent. With Alexion now valued at nearly $22 billion, chances for a near-term deal have been further complicated.“I don’t think this will drive a biotech buying frenzy,” said Morningstar analyst Karen Andersen. She noted that whoever ends up acquiring Onyx might also have been the logical buyer of a company like BioMarin, which develops high-priced drugs used to treat rare genetic diseases.Amgen’s move highlights the appeal of oncology companies like Onyx, which sells drugs for liver, kidney and colon cancer in partnership with Germany’s Bayer AG. The company’s crown jewel is considered to be Kyprolis, a blood cancer drug fully owned by Onyx which was approved by regulators last year.Alexion sells just one drug, but it is a premium-priced treatment for a very rare disease that Deutsche Bank estimates will achieve peak annual sales of $4.6 billion by 2018.“I don’t necessarily believe this puts every company in play,” said Clay Siegall, Chief Executive Officer at Seattle Genetics, which has seen its shares rise 20 percent since mid-June. “There will be more (deals) with time but I don’t think it changes the environment.”He said the focus at Seattle Genetics remains expanding use of its lymphoma drug Adcetris. “Right now we are an emerging company ... we have a great trajectory in the future,” Siegall said. “I believe that our big shareholders are supportive of that. I don’t have any pressure on me to try to run out and do some deal.”The last major biotech deal was in 2011 when French drugmaker Sanofi SA acquired Genzyme, another maker of medicines to treat very rare conditions, or “orphan” diseases, for $20 billion.On June 30, Onyx rejected the unsolicited Amgen bid of $120 a share - a premium of about 38 percent to the company’s share price. Onyx said it would consider other potential buyers and its shares have since soared nearly 47 percent. On Thursday, sources familiar with the matter said that Pfizer Inc had decided not to pursue a competing bid, leaving Amgen in the pole position for a takeover and shares of Onyx fell back to the $128 range.The Onyx offer “says more about Amgen than it does about the deal environment,” said Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges. “Onyx fits really well with what Amgen needs. Amgen has a scarcity of near term growth opportunities and a surplus of infrastructure.”Onyx is fairly unique in its status as a biotech company on the verge of becoming profitable. “The buyers recognize that and I think they are really going to step up,” Porges said.BioMarin is also close to becoming a profit-making company, but CEO Jean-Jacques Bienaime said earlier this year that he would not consider a buyout offer for even a 25-30 percent premium.Shares of BioMarin, which topped Morningstar’s 2013 list of biotech takeover candidates, have gained nearly 8 percent in the last month. Onyx was No. 4 on that list, which included companies like Seattle Genetics and Regeneron.Price is a potential obstacle for buyouts of other perennial takeover targets. Andersen said an acquisition of Regeneron - up more than 11 percent in the last month - has become more problematic given the near doubling in its share price so far this year. Sanofi also holds a big stake in Regeneron.“Most of these companies would be in the high single-digit or low double-digit billions, whereas with Regeneron you are talking a market cap closer to $22 or $23 billion,” Andersen said. “Apply a premium to that ... you have a risky proposition.”Ariad, with shares up 11 percent since the Onyx news, has a commercial product, leukemia drug Iclusig, but its revenue potential is comparatively limited. It also has a pipeline of experimental drugs that will require investment.Others are encumbered by existing development deals with larger companies. Medivation Inc - up 17 percent over the past week - has partnered its promising prostate cancer drug with Japan’s Astellas Pharma Inc, while Pharmacyclics Inc - up 18 percent - is developing leukemia drug ibrutinib in partnership with Johnson & Johnson.“Seattle Genetics is a very rational acquisition target,” Porges said. “But the case of Seattle Genetics is nothing like the case of Onyx where Onyx has already got the cash coming in. Turn off the spending and it automatically becomes profitable.”Meanwhile, neither Roche or Alexion have commented on whether they are in discussions, but some analysts have questioned whether such a costly acquisition would make sense for Roche, which is best known for its innovative cancer medicines and diagnostics business.“We haven’t had a rally like this in more than 10 years - where all the stocks go up and the valuations go out the window,” said Summer Street Research analyst Carol Werther. “Once this trend reverses it is going to be very, very ugly.”"
2013-7-24,"Lilly beats forecast, cuts costs before Cymbalta fades",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0FU0BI20130724,"* Shares rise nearly 3 pct* Adjusted EPS of $1.16 beats analyst view by 16 cents* Raises 2013 profit view on plans for more streamlining* Generic competition looms for antidepressant Cymbalta (Adds analyst comment, company comment, details on drug and animal health sales, updates share price)By Ransdell PiersonJuly 24 (Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co reported higher-than-expected quarterly earnings on Wednesday as it slashed costs ahead of generic competition later this year for its biggest product, antidepressant Cymbalta, and raised its 2013 profit view on plans for more streamlining.Shares of Lilly rose almost 3 percent as investors viewed the cost containment for research, marketing and other expenses in the second half of this year as an important move.“Management appears to be showing prudent cost discipline in anticipation of the Cymbalta patent cliff,” ISI Group analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. The company cut 2 percent from its operating expenses in the second quarter.Global sales of Cymbalta soared 22 percent in the second quarter to $1.5 billion, after having jumped 19 percent in the prior quarter. Sales of the pill are expected to plunge after it loses U.S. patent protection in December.Lilly raised its 2013 earnings forecast to between $4.05 and $4.15 per share, excluding special items, from its earlier outlook of $3.82 to $3.97. It earned $3.39 per share last year.The new 2013 profit forecast would represent growth of 19.5 to 22.5 percent from last year, when earnings sank on generic competition for another big product: Lilly’s Zyprexa schizophrenia treatment.Lilly said on Wednesday that it earned $1.21 billion, or $1.11 per share, in the second quarter. That compared with $924 million, or 83 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding costs of closing a distribution center in Germany and other special items, Lilly earned $1.16 per share. Analysts on average had forecast $1.00, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 6 percent to $5.93 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $5.82 billion.Lilly’s 2013 profit upturn will be short-lived, however. Investors expect earnings to take a tumble of perhaps 25 percent in 2014, as generic versions of Cymbalta and osteoporosis drug Evista flood the market.Sales of Evista rose 5 percent to $279 million. Sales of impotence treatment Cialis jumped 13 percent to $529 million.With recent setbacks for Lilly’s experimental treatments for cancer and Alzheimer’s disease as well as the impending generic competition, investors remain cautious on the company. Its shares have risen 6.1 percent this year, lagging a 17 percent advance for the Arca Pharmaceutical Index of large U.S. and European drugmakers.Lilly has expressed confidence that it would begin rebounding in 2015, helped by promising medicines in clinical trials. These include ramucirumab, for stomach and breast cancer, and treatments for diabetes.Company officials, in a conference call with analysts on Wednesday, also cited high hopes for a new type of cholesterol drug that works by blocking a protein called PCSK9, saying early-stage trials suggest it could be the “best in class” among drugs being developed by a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA, Amgen Inc and others.“Going forward, we see the Lilly story focused on the company’s late-stage pipeline” of experimental drugs, said JP Morgan analyst Chris Schott, who singled out ramucirumab trials in treating breast cancer.Sales from Lilly’s Elanco animal health products rose 6 percent to $544 million in the quarter. The company predicted Elanco’s sales growth will continue to outpace competitors, and said Lilly is aggressively hunting for new deals to bolster the animal-health line of products.Lilly shares were up 2.6 percent at $52.34 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange, off an earlier high at $52.68.

2013-7-26,Europe backs new dual-action Novartis lung drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBRE96P0GB20130726,"LONDON (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis won an important endorsement of its new inhaled medicine for chronic lung disease on Friday when European regulators recommended approval of Ultibro Breezhaler.Also known as QVA149, the once-daily medicine belongs to a new type of dual-action treatments that are expected by analysts to become major sellers and is the first in the class to win such a green light.The green light from the European Medicines Agency (EMA) paves the way for full marketing authorization in the next two or three months. Approval in the key U.S. market remains some way off, since the drug will not be filed there until late 2014.The new product contains two bronchodilators - indacaterol, a long-acting beta2-adrenergic agonist (LABA), and glycopyrronium, a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA).Glycopyrronium was licensed from Vectura, entitling the British firm to milestone payments and royalties on sales. Shares in Ventura rose 7 percent on Friday’s news.Other companies including GlaxoSmithKline are also working to develop such LABA/LAMA combinations.Novartis is banking on new drugs, including QVA149, to fill the gap left by the loss of exclusivity on its blockbuster blood pressure pill Diovan. It also has high hopes for Serelaxin, a treatment for acute heart failure and psoriasis drug AIN457.QVA149 is designed to treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a disease that causes breathing trouble and chronic coughing, and is sometimes fatal. It affects an estimated 210 million people worldwide.Analysts at Berenberg said Ultibro could achieve annual sales of around $2.3 billion by 2021, of which $1.7 billion could be generated outside the United States.The EMA said it had also recommended a new HIV medicine from Gilead Sciences called Tybost, or cobicistat, a drug that does not itself fight the virus that causes AIDS but boosts the function of other HIV medicines.The European recommendation contrasts with a rebuff for the Gilead product from U.S. regulators in April.In addition, the EMA issued a positive opinion for Gentium’s drug Defitelio for use in patients undergoing blood stem-cell transplantation, and Boehringer Ingelheim’s lung cancer drug Giotrif.GSK’s Revolade was recommended for wider use in patients with thrombocytopenia associated with chronic hepatitis C infection, while Bayer’s Eylea was backed for wider use in eye disease. Regeneron is Bayer’s partner on Eylea.Otsuka’s new drug Delamanid for treating multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, however, was not recommended for approval.Recommendations for marketing approval by the agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months."
2013-8-06,Regeneron\'s Eylea improves vision in diabetic eye condition,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0G61JY20130806,"Aug 6 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Eylea helped improve the vision of patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) significantly better than laser surgery in a pair of late-stage clinical trials, paving the way for an expanded approval of the sight-saving medicine, the company said on Tuesday.Eylea is already approved to treat wet age-related macular edema, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.The condition associated with diabetes is the leading cause of blindness in younger and middle aged adults, with potentially more than 6 million treatable patients worldwide, the U.S. biotechnology company said.As a result of the two successful trials, called Vivid-DME and Vista-DME, Regeneron said it plans to apply for U.S. approval to treat diabetic macular edema in 2013 - a year ahead of its previously projected timeline.Bayer AG, which sells the drug outside the United States, also will apply for European DME approval this year.Patients in the two year-long studies received either monthly injections of Eylea, or injections every other month following a course of five monthly injections. Eylea treatment was compared with laser photocoagulation, a type of laser surgery in which leaky blood vessels in the eye are cauterized to stop the leakage that leads to vision loss.In the Vista-DME trial, those who received monthly Eylea on average were able to see 12.5 more letters on an eye chart test after one year, than prior to receiving treatment. Those in the every other month group saw vision improve by 10.7 letters. That compared with a mean change of just 0.2 letters for the laser group.In the Vivid-DME trial the vision improvements were 10.5 letters and 10.7 letters for the Eylea monthly and less frequent dosing groups, respectively, versus an improvement of 1.2 letters for those who received laser treatment.All the results for Eylea were deemed by researchers to be highly statistically significant.Eylea was generally well tolerated in the studies with the incidence of serious adverse side effects similar across all three treatment groups, the company said.The drug was first approved in November of 2011 for wet age-related macular degeneration and received an additional approval a year later to treat macular edema following a condition known as central retinal vein occlusion.It has been grabbing market share from Roche Holding’s similar Lucentis, leading Regeneron to repeatedly increase Eylea sales forecasts since its approval.The company is currently expecting 2013 Eylea sales of $1.25 billion to $1.33 billion."

Regeneron’s second-quarter profit came in below Wall Street expectations.“Positive results for Eylea in DME were widely expected by the Street, though the filing is now coming earlier. Overall, 2Q looks mixed to us,” J.P. Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham wrote in a note.Eylea was approved in November 2011 to treat wet age-related macular degeneration - the leading cause of blindness in the elderly - and has become one of the fastest-growing medicines in the history of biotechnology.U.S. sales of the drug rose 70 percent in the second quarter to $330 million, slowing from growth of 153 percent in the first quarter, the company reported on Tuesday.“As the dosing interval increases, the number of doses per quarter do decline, so we’re dependent on getting new patients into the marketplace,” Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said on a conference call with analysts.Eylea is given by injection into the eye every four weeks for the first three months, but is subsequently only administered every two months.The company, betting on growing demand for the drug, raised its 2013 sales estimate for Eylea to between $1.30 billion and $1.35 billion from its earlier estimate of $1.25 billion to $1.33 billion.Eylea has been steadily grabbing market share from Roche Holding’s similar drug Lucentis, leading Regeneron to repeatedly increase Eylea sales forecasts since its approval.Piper Jaffray analyst Edward Tenthoff on Tuesday predicted U.S. Eylea sales will hit $1.89 billion in 2014, accompanied by growing sales of the product in Europe, where sales are split with Bayer AG.Tenthoff called Tuesday’s selloff a buying opportunity and said he expects Regeneron shares to climb to $336 within 12 months, up from his earlier price target of $274 on the stock.He said the company’s array of experimental medicines, most of which are being developed in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi SA, will continue to capture investor interest.“Eylea is a great drug, but Regeneron has 11 other antibodies” in testing, he said, including drugs in late-stage trials to treat rheumatoid arthritis and high levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol.Two new late-stage trials showed Eylea significantly improved vision in patients with DME compared to laser surgery.With the new data, Regeneron said it planned to apply for U.S. approval for Eylea to treat DME in 2013 - a year ahead of its previously projected timeline.DME is a major cause of blindness in younger and middle-aged adults, with potentially more than 6 million treatable patients worldwide and represents a huge potential market for Eylea.Patients in the 2-year-long DME studies, called Vivid-DME and Vista-DME, received either monthly injections of Eylea, or injections every other month following a course of five monthly injections.Eylea treatment was compared with laser photocoagulation, a type of laser surgery in which leaky blood vessels in the eye are cauterized to stop the leakage that leads to vision loss.In the Vista-DME trial, those who received monthly Eylea on average were able to see 12.5 more letters on an eye chart test after one year compared to before receiving treatment.Those in the every-other-month group saw vision improve by 10.7 letters.

2013-8-27,Roche looks to replicate cancer success with eye drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0GS3CF20130827,"* Lampalizumab slows progression of geographic atrophy* Currently no approved treatments for the disease* Roche already has treatment for wet AMD* Sees huge opportunity in ophthalmologyBy Caroline CopleyZURICH, Aug 27 (Reuters) - Positive results for Roche’s experimental eye drug should bolster its position in the multibillion-dollar-a-year market for vision loss treatments, as it looks to branch out beyond its core cancer expertise.After scrapping drugs to treat diabetes and boost levels of “good” high-density cholesterol, the world’s largest maker of cancer drugs is hoping to prove it has a stronger hand when it comes to developing treatments for the eyes.The company has already chalked up one success with Lucentis, a treatment for wet age-related macula degeneration (AMD), which had sales of $1.5 billion in the United States last year. The macula is the part of the eye that allows fine detail to be seen.But it has been losing market share to Regeneron and Bayer’s Eylea, making success with lampalizumab - its treatment for the dry form of AMD known as geographic atrophy (GA) - all the more pressing if it wants to consolidate its place as a key player in the market.“While we have been a very oncology-focused company, ophthalmology is an area where there’s a huge amount of opportunity,” Carole Ho, director of Early Clinical Development at Roche’s biotech unit Genentech told Reuters in an interview prior to the data being published.There are currently no approved treatments for geographic atrophy, a leading cause of blindness in adults over 55, which gradually causes vision loss in the macula, making it harder to read, drive and recognise people’s faces.More than 8 million people worldwide are affected by the disease and the numbers are expected to rise as the ranks of the elderly swell, making it a lucrative space for drugmakers.Results of the phase II clinical trial presented at the American Society of Retina Specialists in Toronto on Tuesday found lampalizumab reduced this type of atrophy by 20.4 percent at 18 months in patients with this dry form of AMD.The data, also showed no unexpected or unmanageable side effects with the drug, Roche said.Although it is still early days, Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said the data was strong and estimated the market opportunity for the drug at over $5 billion globally, potentially making it a more meaningful for Roche than Lucentis.Lampalizumab, which Genentech acquired when it bought Tanox in 2007, works by inhibiting the protein Factor D, which regulates the cell-destruction properties of the immune system.Developing targeted therapies has already helped Genentech churn out multiple top-selling cancer drugs. It hopes those same tools will help it prove it is on the right track with treatments for vision loss as well.In the phase II trial, Roche identified a specific sub-population of GA patients using exploratory biomarkers - a tool which helps it identify the efficacy of its drugs earlier. Among that group, the rate of GA slowed by 44 percent at 18 months.“As we understand the science better, and if we see successes in our treatment of more advanced stages, we’d be looking to go and impact the disease earlier,” Ho said.As well as developing its own drugs in-house, Roche is also interested in other companies working in this field, she added.One company that has been touted as a natural takeover target for Roche is U.S. biotech Opthotech, which is developing a drug that can be combined with Lucentis.Other rivals in the eye drug field include Novartis which sells Lucentis outside the United States.

Sanofi and L’Oreal shares were little changed.Speculation over the fate of L’Oreal’s stake in Sanofi has been fuelled by last month’s comments from L’Oreal’s CEO that the cosmetics company could buy back the 23-billion-euro ($30-billion) stake Nestle holds in it if L’Oreal in turn sold the 9-billion-euro stake it owns in Sanofi.The comments have weighed on Sanofi shares, already dragged down by disappointing quarterly results, but some analysts say the drugmaker could use the opportunity to repurchase the shares with cheap debt, thereby boosting its earnings.Asked about his potential interest in buying back L’Oreal’s stake from next year, Viehbacher said it was difficult to comment because the issue was highly conditional.“We certainly have cash flow to do some things,” he told a Bank of America Merrill Lynch healthcare conference in London.“Whether we would intervene in that or not is going to be a function of - if it does happen - what at that given point in time is the best use of capital. It may well be opportune to have a look at it.”Restrictions on Nestle selling its L’Oreal stake end in April.More generally, Viehbacher said he did not exclude other share buybacks, but said these would depend on opportunities for acquisitions.He said Sanofi could also look at raising its stake in Regeneron to as much as 30 percent. Sanofi holds about 16 percent of Regeneron and said in February it has the right to increase this to a maximum 30 percent under its decade-long partnership with Regeneron.“The Regeneron relationship has become extremely productive for us,” Viehbacher said. “Over time, it could well make sense to build our stake up to 30 percent. How fast we do that, whether or not we do that is a function of a number of different factors - but it is a bulky chunk of money to use.”Regeneron’s market value is about $27 billion.Regeneron is best known for its eye drug Eylea, co-marketed with Bayer. But it has also successfully developed the cancer treatment Zaltrap with Sanofi and is working with the French group on a new kind of cholesterol drug.The drug, which is in late-stage trials, has cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by 60 percent through a new mechanism - blocking a protein called PCSK9.

They work differently from statins - pills that inhibit the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.“Physician feedback suggests high awareness amongst cardiologists and planned prescribing habits support multi-billion dollar potential for the class,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note on Wednesday, forecasting peak annual sales of alirocumab of more than $3 billion.Independent research firm BioMedTracker sees sales of alirocumab reaching $3.7 billion by 2023.Sanofi and U.S. biotech firm Regeneron are among leaders in the race to bring a drug from this new class to market, neck-and-neck with Amgen. Pfizer, Eli Lilly and Roche have rival products at earlier stages of clinical development.If positive, results from a first 100-patient trial - due any day now - will boost Sanofi’s confidence in its drug, which may reach the market by 2015. But its ultimate success depends on longer-term studies involving thousands of patients, some of which will only produce results in around five years.In the first Phase III study, alirocumab, which has cut levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 72 percent in Phase II trials, is being tested against Merck’s Zetia, which can lower LDL cholesterol by 19-24 percent. Deutsche analysts expect it to easily achieve its goal in the trial.Alirocumab is likely to used in patients with genetically-high cholesterol levels, high-risk patients who do not hit their cholesterol goals on statins alone, and patients intolerant to statins, whose side effects can include muscle pain.Doctors at the European Society of Cardiology congress in Amsterdam earlier this month said PCSK9 drugs could be a valuable new weapon against heart disease.But many were wary of predicting widespread use before seeing final-stage clinical data, following past disappoints with other heart drugs, including pills raising “good” HDL cholesterol.The requirement for the new medicines to be injected and their expected high cost are also seen as potential deterrents, with pricing expected to be especially an issue in Europe, where healthcare spending is pressured by deficit-slashing policies.For alirocumab, analysts expect a price of around $15 per day, comparable to the cost of injectable diabetes drugs known as GLP-1s, such as Novo Nordisk’s Victoza.At an investor conference earlier this month, Sanofi’s CEO Chris Viehbacher said the French drugmaker could look at nearly doubling its stake in Regeneron, voicing confidence in the drug’s success.“When you look at the number of patients who are willing to inject themselves daily for diabetes, and you know a lot of those patients are also going to be in your patient population for PCSK9, I actually think that the injectable part is not going to be as big a barrier as people think,” Viehbacher said.“I think it is going to be a paradigm shift for healthcare and a potentially huge opportunity for us.”"

2014-1-02,German watchdog deals setback to Bayer eye drug Eylea,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0KC1Y420140102,"FRANKFURT, Jan 2 (Reuters) - Bayer suffered a setback in its home market of Germany on Thursday when a healthcare cost watchdog said it was unable to assess whether its new eye medication Eylea offered an advantage over a rival product from Novartis.The opinion issued by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, or IQWiG, could affect the level of reimbursement by public insurers for Eylea in Germany.IQWiG compared trial data on Eylea and Novartis’s Lucentis for treatment of macular edema - a build-up of fluid under the centre of the retina following a blockage of the retina’s major vein.It said it was unable to assess whether Eylea was more effective than Lucentis, which is sold by Roche in the United States and by Novartis elsewhere, because in the trials neither drug was being administered in the way specified by regulators when it was approved for use in Germany.IQWiG’s opinions are taken into account by Germany’s medical cost-benefit agency G-BA, which is due to publish an assessment of Eylea’s cost-effectiveness within the next three months. Bayer said it would respond to IQWiG’s statement within three weeks.Bayer has said it expects Eylea, also known as VEGF Trap-Eye, to generate more than 1 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in peak annual sales. Bayer HealthCare and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals are collaborating in Eylea’s development.IQWiG also said Bayer’s cancer treatment Stivarga, another potential blockbuster drug, had advantages over alternative treatment, albeit minor ones.While trials did show that Stivarga helped cancer patients live longer, the treatment also carried frequent, severe side-effects, it said."

The drug is expected to be tested for safety and efficacy early this year.AMD is a chronic condition that requires visually impaired patients to make monthly visits to the clinic.Since its launch in late 2011, Eylea has become one of the fastest-growing medicines in the history of biotechnology, grabbing market share from rivals such as Roche AG’s Lucentis.Bayer and Regeneron are also collaborating on the development of Eylea, which is currently being tested for use in diabetic macular edema (DME) and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron closed at $268.68 on the Nasdaq on Monday."

2014-1-14,Regeneron to report $400 mln 4th quarter Eylea sales-CEO,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0KO19D20140114,"Jan 14 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc will report about $400 million in U.S. sales of its high-profile eye drug Eylea for the fourth quarter of 2013, bringing the total for the year to about $1.4 billion with lots of room for future sales growth, the U.S. biotech company’s chief executive said on Tuesday.Regeneron CEO Len Schleifer called the Eylea franchise far from mature and said sales of the drug have “plenty of room for growth” in both the United States and Europe through approvals for additional uses and other initiatives.Schleifer also said the company has the potential for five major regulatory submissions or approvals in the next five years, including expanded approvals for Eylea, as well as drugs for rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, atopic dermatitis and its closely watched drug to lower “bad” LDL cholesterol from a highly promising new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors.Regeneron shares jumped more than 9 percent following Schleifer’s comments during a presentation at the JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco.The $400 million in U.S. fourth-quarter sales is up from $363 million in the third quarter despite holidays in the period that cut down on doctor visits. Regeneron reports U.S. sales of the drug used to treat wet age-related macular edema - the leading cause of blindness in the elderly - while Bayer AG sells Eylea in Europe.Sales growth of Eylea has slowed from its rocket-like rise following a late 2011 approval in part because patients who have been taking the drug for several months typically move to less-frequent injections.Regeneron expects applications seeking approval of the PCSK9 cholesterol fighter, alirocumab, to be filed in Europe in early 2015 and for the United States later that year, the CEO said.Schleifer said he believes the drug could win initial approval before completion of a lengthy heart safety study as long as that study is well underway.Regeneron is developing the drugs in its pipeline in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi, which owns about 16 percent of the biotech and pays the lion’s share of research and development expenses for the joint projects.Sanofi is expected to spend more than $1 billion on the Regeneron pipeline in 2014, Schleifer said.“We have lots going on,” he added.Regeneron shares were up $24.76, or 9.2 percent, at $293.44 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

2014-1-23,Amgen cholesterol drug meets goal of 3rd late stage trial,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA0M1EV20140123,"(Reuters) - A cholesterol fighter developed by Amgen Inc from a highly promising new class of medicines significantly lowered levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol in a late stage trial in patients unable to tolerate statin drugs, the company said on Thursday.The results marked the third successful Phase III test of the drug evolocumab reported by Amgen in recent months - this one in a patient population among the most in need of alternative therapies.An estimated five to 20 percent of heart patients are intolerant of statin medications for lowering cholesterol due to side effects such as muscle weakness or fatigue, Amgen said.Evolocumab belongs to a class of medicine called PCSK9 inhibitors that work by blocking a protein that reduces the liver’s ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.Based on dramatic LDL lowering demonstrated by Amgen and other companies in earlier studies, PCSK9 inhibitors could be the most important new heart drugs to come along in several years with multibillion-dollar sales potential.The injected medicines are likely to be used in high risk heart patients unable to lower their LDL levels sufficiently with high doses of widely used statin drugs, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, and in those unable to take statins.Many patients remain at high risk of heart attack and stroke “despite the use of all available therapies,” Amgen research and development chief Sean Harper said in a telephone interview.“The ability to treat those individuals with a completely distinct mechanism and see this very large effect size of dropping LDL cholesterol by roughly 50 percent, that’s a pretty big deal for those patients,” Harper said.The company expects during the current quarter to have results of its final two Phase III studies - one in patients already taking high doses of statins and one in patients genetically predisposed to dangerously high cholesterol levels.Amgen will provide details of its latest 307-patient Phase III study, called GAUSS-2, which compared evolocumab to Merck & Co’s Zetia (ezetimibe), at an upcoming medical meeting.However, the world’s largest biotech company said the percentage of cholesterol lowering was consistent with those observed in a similar, smaller Phase II trial.

2014-1-23,Amgen cholesterol drug meets goal of third late stage trial,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0KX1CS20140123,"Jan 23 (Reuters) - A cholesterol fighter developed by Amgen Inc from a new class of medicines succeeded in significantly lowering levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol in a late stage trial in patients unable to tolerate statin drugs, the company said on Thursday.The results marked the third successful Phase III test of the drug evolocumab reported by Amgen in recent months - this one in a patient population among the most in need of alternative therapies.Evolocumab belongs to a class of medicine called PCSK9 inhibitors that work by blocking a protein that reduces the liver’s ability to remove LDL cholesterol from the blood.Based on dramatic LDL lowering demonstrated by Amgen and other companies in earlier studies, PCSK9 inhibitors could be the most important new heart drugs to come along in several years with multibillion-dollar sales potential.The injected medicines are likely to be used in high risk heart patients unable to lower their LDL levels sufficiently with high doses of widely used statin drugs, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, and in those unable to tolerate statins.Amgen will provide details of its latest 307-patient Phase III study, called GAUSS-2, which compared evolocumab to Merck & Co’s Zetia (ezetimibe), at an upcoming medical meeting.However, the world’s largest biotech company said the percentage of cholesterol lowering was consistent with those observed in a similar, smaller Phase II trial. In that study, evolocumab led to 51 percent reduction in LDL levels and 61 percent when combined with Zetia versus a 15 percent reduction seen with Zetia alone.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, in partnership with Sanofi, is also in Phase III testing of a rival drug.

2014-10-22,Amgen boss makes a prime breakup target,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUS186746352220141022,"The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own. Amgen’s boss makes a prime breakup target for Dan Loeb. Former Morgan Stanley banker Robert Bradway has run the $109 billion biotech being eyed by the activist investor for the past two years. The idea of splitting such companies into a cash cow and a growth arm comes up often, but rarely happens. Amgen may be the exception.Its stock has significantly lagged rivals Gilead, Biogen Idec and Regeneron over the past decade. Sales of its blockbuster drugs for anemia have sharply fallen after safety concerns emerged. Loeb’s primary target are the company’s weaknesses; he wants Bradway to cut expenses – its prodigious R&D has generated more expenses than hits – and improve capital allocation. But the activist also wants the company to consider the more radical idea of splitting in two.It’s not a new idea for the industry. Sanofi studied it a decade ago. Merck and Pfizer mulled it over more recently. The idea is that one company takes the drugs already on the market, generating cash and paying dividends. The other focuses on drugs under development.The problem is that most drugs have a finite earnings shelf life. Once patent protection is lost, sales rapidly fall to zero. The other danger is that the declining business decides it wants to live and starts spending heavily on R&D or M&A. Meanwhile, the unit responsible for all the growth matures and starts paying a dividend. Keeping them together tends to make more sense.If any company is amenable to a split, though, it’s Amgen. The company’s biological drugs are hard to copy so are likely to face limited competition even when patent protection expires. That means sales revenue from established medicines ought to decline slowly.The two businesses could be worth up to $120 billion in total according to a Sanford Bernstein research note put out this summer that Loeb referenced. The stock has jumped by more than a fifth since.Bradway’s past as an investment banker means he more than many of his rival CEOs should appreciate the benefit of deploying some Wall Street-style financial engineering if it can create value. The idea may be a long shot, which may explain why Loeb is pulling his punches. But he has picked the right target."
2014-10-31,"What to Watch in the Week Ahead and on Monday, Nov. 3",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N0SQ8ZU20141031,"(The Day Ahead is an email and PDF publication that includes the day’s major stories and events, analyses and other features. To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT) WEEK AHEAD A series of Federal Reserve officials give speeches after the U.S. central bank surprised some investors last week with a hawkish-sounding policy statement that confidently predicted only temporary weakness in inflation. Policymakers from across the Fed’s ideological spectrum take to podiums with the dovish head of the Minneapolis Fed Narayana Kocherlakota speaking on Wednesday, and fellow policy-committee members Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester and Fed Governor Jerome Powell speaking on Thursday, among others. Now that the central bank has ended its massive bond-buying stimulus, financial markets are keen for any insight on how quickly it will raise interest rates after nearly seven years near zero. U.S. employers likely expanded their payrolls by a healthy 233,000 in October, according to a Reuters poll, a figure that would validate the Federal Reserve’s conclusion that the job market continues to make strides toward full health. The jobless rate is seen holding at the six-year low reached in September. The report on Friday will be the highlight of a data-heavy week that includes readings on trade and the services and manufacturing sectors. The ISM’s services sector report on Wednesday is likely to show a similar pattern. On Tuesday, the government is expected to report that the nation’s trade gap narrowed in September, while data from payroll processor ADP on Wednesday is expected to show private payroll growth accelerated slightly in October. The blockbuster “Guardians of the Galaxy” movie, the highest-grossing movie of the year, is expected to boost quarterly results for Dow component Walt Disney Co when the media and theme park giant reports its fourth quarter on Thursday. The company is likely to report better-than-expected profit and revenue, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Warren Buffett’s sprawling conglomerate, Berkshire Hathaway Inc, reports third quarter results on Friday. Analysts expect the company to report earnings per Class A share of $2,592.73, from $3,074 in the year-ago quarter. World’s largest steel producer ArcelorMittal SA presents third quarter results on Friday, which are likely to show divergence between the now buoyant steel industry (particularly in the United States) and muted mining business, which led it to cut its full-year forecast in July. Media companies Discovery Communications Inc and Twenty-First Century Fox Inc are scheduled to report quarterly results on Tuesday. Discovery’s third-quarter earnings are expected to be below analysts’ expectations while Fox is likely to miss estimates for its first-quarter results, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. On Wednesday, Time Warner Inc and CBS Corp will report third quarter results. Time Warner results are expected to be slightly below the average analysts’ expectation and CBS is also likely to miss analysts’ estimates. On Thursday, digital media and entertainment company AOL Inc is expected to report third-quarter profit above estimates. DirecTV, the No.1 U.S. satellite TV provider, is expected to report third-quarter earnings slightly below analysts’ expectations on Thursday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. Investors will look for plans in Latin America, its largest growth area. Cable company Cablevision Systems Corp’s third quarter results on Thursday are likely to beat analysts’ average estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. On the same day cable TV network AMC Networks Inc is expected to report third quarter revenue above analysts’ average estimate. Tesla Motors Inc will report its third quarter results on Wednesday and barring a surprise in the results themselves the real focus will be on progress toward the Model X SUV launch as well as construction of the battery gigafatory. Analysts have speculated the Model X launch could be delayed, but the company has not said that. Meanwhile, Tesla continues its plans to build the lithium-ion battery factory in the United States and investors will be listening for more details on that schedule. Duke Energy Corp reporting third-quarter results on Wednesday is expected to report a higher profit for the fourth straight quarter, helped by cost cuts and increasing power demand in North Carolina, South Carolina and Florida. The company, which gets nearly 87 percent of its revenue from electric utilities, have benefited from higher power prices set by regulators. Duke Energy, which has been trying to exit the volatility of wholesale power markets, sold some Midwest power assets in August. Investors will want to know about the future of its utilities holdings and demand.In the oil and gas sector, a slew of companies reporting results include oil producer EOG Resources Inc and independent refiner Valero Energy Corp with third quarter results on Tuesday; Continental Resources Inc, refiner HollyFrontier Inc and offshore oil and gas drilling services provider Rowan Co on Wednesday. Apache Corp and offshore drilling contractor Transocean Ltd report results on Thursday. While Continental is expected to post a jump in quarterly profit, Transocean is expected to post a lower profit. HollyFrontier and Rowan both are expected to report a higher quarterly profit. Cash-strapped miner Molycorp Inc is expected to report a third-quarter loss and revenue nearly unchanged from the year-ago period on Wednesday, as it sold more rare earth but at lower prices. Investors will mainly look for comments on the company securing additional funds to ramp up operations at its flagship Mountain Pass facility in California, for which the company secured a loan of $400 million from Oaktree Capital Management in August. IT services provider Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp is likely to report third-quarter revenue below estimates on Wednesday as it expects delays in booking revenue from large deals, which the company’s CEO attributed to leadership changes in some North American and UK clients. Emerson Electric Co, which manufactures automation and power supply systems, reports fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on Tuesday. Analysts will be looking for more information about Emerson’s growth next year after the company in October said its underlying sales growth would “slightly exceed” its rate in 2014. Second-largest U.S. life insurer Prudential Financial Inc’s third quarter results on Wednesday are expected to miss expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The weak Japanese yen, which fell about 8.2 percent against the dollar in the third quarter, is likely to hurt the company as it earns more than half of its revenue from international operations, mainly Japan. In the health care sector, Becton Dickinson and Co and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc report quarterly results on Tuesday, Actavis Plc reports third quarter results on Wednesday, Hospira Inc reports on Thursday and Humana Inc on Friday. Premium beauty products maker Estee Lauder Cos Inc will report first quarter results before the bell on Tuesday. The company has been growing sales faster than those of rivals such as L’Oreal SA, Coty Inc, and Elizabeth Arden in key U.S. and European markets, where demand for its Clinique Dramatically Different Moisturizing Lotion and Estee Lauder Pure Color Envy Sculpting Lipstick are driving sales. Motorola Solutions Inc is likely to report third-quarter revenue below expectations on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast a drop in sales due to lower demand in North America, citing budget cuts and lowered government spending in the United States. Symantec Corp, which makes Norton antivirus software, is expected to post a third quarter profit below the average analyst estimate on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. While the antivirus business has been hurt by slowing PC sales, sluggish demand for its storage and data management software continues to hurt its other business. Fast food chain Burger King Worldwide Inc is expected to report third quarter profit and sales above the average analysts’ estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine. The company is expected to benefit from higher traffic in its restaurants in the United States, its largest market. Investors will be looking for more details on its deal to acquire Canadian coffee and doughnut chain Tim Hortons Inc as well as comments on outlook for the remainder of 2014, given higher foods cost, particularly for beef. On Thursday, third-largest U.S. quick service hamburger company The Wendy’s Co is expected to miss estimates for both third quarter profit and revenue. Molson Coors Brewing Co, which brews, markets and sells beer brands such as Coors Light, Molson Canadian, Carling, and Blue Moon, will report third quarter results before the bell on Thursday. The brewer has been helped by newer launches and higher growth in international markets, offsetting volume declines in the United States and Canada. It expects to spend higher on brand investments in the second half of this year. Investors worried about decelerating same-store sales at Whole Foods Market Inc are bracing for the natural and organic food seller’s forecasts for fiscal 2015 when it reports fourth-quarter results on Wednesday. Whole Foods is losing its grip on the niche it pioneered amid competition from rivals ranging from specialty grocers like Sprouts and Fresh Market to mainstream food sellers Wal-Mart and Kroger. Skyworks Solutions Inc, which supplies radio frequency chips to Apple, which reports results on Thursday, estimated fourth quarter adjusted profit and revenue above its previous forecast. Skyworks has been benefiting from higher demand from handset makers, particularly Apple. The company’s upbeat estimates come at a time when investors are concerned about a broad-based downturn in the semiconductor industry due to lower demand for electronic devices. 3D printer maker Stratasys Ltd is likely to report a better-than-expected third quarter profit on Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company, which holds 55 percent of the market for printers priced at over $10,000, had raised its forecast for the full year in August on strong demand for its 3D printers. The company is also expected to face higher competition as other traditional printer makers such as HP has announced plans to enter the 3D printing market with faster and cheaper technology. Analysts and investors are looking for guidance in the context of competition from HP. Cyber-security vendor FireEye Inc forecast current quarter revenue above analysts’ estimate in August, citing strong demand for its software and services. The company reports third quarter results on Tuesday and investors will look out for management commentary on demand for its security products and current quarter outlook. Time Inc, the largest magazine publisher in the United States, is expected to report third quarter profit below the average estimate on Tuesday, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The publisher of Sports Illustrated, Time magazine and People is facing declining circulation and advertising revenue as consumers shift to reading on smartphones and tablets. The company, which gets half of its revenue from advertising, had cut its full year forecast last quarter, citing payment defaults and the relocation of its headquarters. With newspapers struggling, News Corp has been spending its money in interesting places including real estate listing site Move Inc - its biggest acquisition to date. The company reports fiscal first quarter results on Wednesday.Office supplies retailer Office Depot Inc has warned that sales would be weak this year as stiff competition from online and mass retailers erodes sales in its North American retail division. To improve its business it said it was implementing a program to refine its unique selling proposition and is concentrating on two segments where it is significantly underpenetrated. Investors will be interested in details on these two segments as well as steps the company is taking to arrest the decline in sales in North America. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, third quarter sales are expected to miss the average analysts’ forecast on Tuesday. The European Central Bank meeting on Thursday will be the main money event in Europe in the coming week - despite the fact that it is not likely to be one of action. As usual, the attention will be on ECB chief Mario Draghi’s nuances at the news conference that follows the likely non-decision. The Bank of England looks also looks to keep interest rates on hold at record low levels after three of its most senior officials expressed staunch opposition to hiking rates in the last two weeks. On Friday, shares of Freshpet Inc, a maker of healthy food for cats and dogs, and Chinese solar park-operator Sky Solar Holdings Ltd are expected to start trading on the Nasdaq.

October consumer confidence data for Mexico will be released on Wednesday after the index hit a three month high in September as shoppers became more optimistic about the outlook for the country’s economy. Data on Friday will show whether inflation, which hit 4.22 percent in September, continued to climb above the central bank’s 4 percent ceiling. MONDAY, NOVEMBER 3 U.S. manufacturing likely lost half a step in October, but still moved forward at a pace that would provide a solid underpinning for growth. The Institute of Supply Management releases its monthly manufacturing report for October (1000/1500). Also on the radar is September construction spending data from the Commerce Department (1000/1500) and auto sales data for October. Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas President Richard Fisher speaks before a Shadow Open Market Committee meeting sponsored by the Manhattan Institute in New York (1240/1740). Sprint Corp, the third largest wireless carrier in the United States, is expected to post a loss of 177,000 postpaid subscribers, as the company continues a network overhaul that has caused gaps in coverage. Sprint has undergone mass restructuring this year with round after round of layoffs, as its new CEO, Marcelo Claure attempts to turn the company around. When the company reports second-quarter results, investors will look for signs of a turn around, the impact of recent pricing plans and indications of more layoffs to come. Marathon Oil Corp, which has operations in Kurdistan, Libya and the United States, will report third-quarter earnings and provide an update on its goal to grow production from shale formations including the Eagle Ford in South Texas. At the same time, a steep drop in crude oil is likely to hurt profitability. Canada’s Agrium Inc, a fertilizer producer and retail seller of farm products, reports third-quarter results. The company warned in October that earnings per share from continuing operations would be lower than Street estimates, but the reason was not clear. One possibility is that falling crop prices have caused farmers to rein in spending on chemicals and fertilizer, hitting the company’s North American retail chain. Also of interest will be fourth-quarter guidance and an update on completing expansion of Agrium’s Saskatchewan potash mine. The company holds its Investor Day on Wednesday. Of interest will be the company’s thinking on whether to buy a new source of phosphate production to replace mines that are nearly tapped out, or exit that space. UK-based bank HSBC Plc reports third-quarter results. Regulation and conduct are the key issues for the bank, specifically the leverage ratio issue and the ongoing FX probe. Hotel, energy and financial services conglomerate Loews Corp’s third quarter is likely to be weak as its biggest holding, insurer CNA Financial, faces a slowing pace of rate increases. However, some of that weakness should be offset by stronger results at Diamond Offshore, Loews’ offshore rig contractor, which reported a 4.5 percent rise in third-quarter revenue, helped by higher demand and improved rates for its ultra-deepwater rigs. Insurer American Internaitonal Group Inc will report third quarter earnings. This will be the first quarter in which the company was, at least part of the time, helmed by new CEO Peter Hancock, who took over from Bob Benmosche on Sept. 1. Analysts expect the insurer to post earnings of $1.09 per share. Investors will be watching to see not only how the company is faring under its new chief but also how it is managing expenses around the world. It hosts a conference call to discuss its results on Tuesday. Herbalife Ltd, the nutrition-product maker facing allegations that it runs a pyramid scheme, will report third quarter results after the bell. According to Thomson Reuters StarMine, the company is expected to miss both profit and sales expectations on weak sales of its daily consumable products such as energy drinks and multi-vitamin tablets. Investors, however, will be more interested in hearing management’s commentary on the FTC probe on the company and whether some form of disciplinary action is imminent. They will also keep an eye on the size of Herbalife’s network of distributors, which has been stagnating. Shares of Kimberly-Clark Corp’s healthcare division, slated to be called Halyard Health, are expected to start trading on the New York Stock Exchange. Halyard began to see a surge in demand for its protective medical devices in the wake of the Ebola scare. Halyard also sells products that cater to the needs of the elderly, such as pain relief medication and devices. Existing Kimberly-Clark shareholders could exchange eight shares of Kimberly for one Halyard share. Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz will speak on “The legacy of the financial crisis, what we know and what we don’t.” It will be his first public speech since publishing the Oct. 22 Monetary Policy Report, and it will be made to the Canadian Council for Public-Private Partnerships in Toronto. The RBC Canadian Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ index for October is scheduled for release. The pace of growth in the manufacturing sector cooled to a seasonally adjusted 53.5 in September from August (0930/1430). Automakers report their Canadian sales for the month of October. The industry is heading for a record year - in September, Chrysler Canada said it was on track for its best full-year sales ever, and Ford reported its highest year-to-date sales in Canada in more than 15 years. Taken together, in September the automakers operated at a seasonally adjusted rate of 2 million sales per year for the first time, according to DesRosiers Automotive Consultants.

All times in ET/GMT) Online retailer Alibaba Group Holding Ltd releases its first full-length set of quarterly numbers since going public in what became the world’s largest initial public offering. Investors have so far overlooked its poor track record on corporate governance, but it remains to be seen if Alibaba lives up to its promise of hyper-growth, and if its expansion into all things mobile has begun to yield fruit. The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to report that the trade gap narrowed slightly in September. Depending on the actual figures, economists could adjust their expectations for the next revision on third-quarter gross domestic product growth due near the end of the month (0830/1330). Also scheduled for release is the Institute of Supply Management-New York’s index on factory activity for October (0945/1445) and the government’s report on factory orders for September, which are seen picking up slightly after a big aircraft-related drop (1000/1500).The United States holds midterm elections, with 36 U.S. Senate seats, all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and 36 state governors’ races at stake, as well as votes on a string of state ballot measures such as legal marijuana, and on state and local governments. Dish Network Corp, the second-largest U.S. satellite TV company, is expected to report a slight fall in its third-quarter revenue, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company has been playing hard ball with television networks such as CBS and Turner Broadcasting to renew distribution deals. The standoff comes as cable, satellite and telecom video distributors are increasingly resisting demands for steep price increases as viewers are being drawn to Netflix and other forms of entertainment. Media company Discovery Communications Inc is expected to report third-quarter earnings below the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Growth of international television ad sales, which Discovery has been benefiting from in the past few quarters, has taken a hit, according to analysts, from tensions between Russia and the West over Ukraine and a stronger dollar.After walking away from a potential tie-up with Time Warner Inc, Twenty-First Century Fox Inc is expected to outline its future plans. The company is likely to miss the analysts’ estimate for its first-quarter results, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. Time Warner’s plan to launch a standalone online streaming service for HBO next year may also have repercussions for Fox. Time Inc, the largest magazine publisher in the United States, is expected to report a third-quarter profit below the average analyst estimate, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The publisher of Sports Illustrated, and Time and People magazines is facing declining circulation and advertising revenue as consumers shift to reading on smartphones and tablets.

Separately, Oasis Petroleum, which produces oil and natural gas in North Dakota’s Bakken formation, is expected to report after the market closes a jump in third-quarter profit. Emerson Electric Co, which manufactures automation and power supply systems, reports fourth-quarter earnings. Analysts will be looking for more information about Emerson’s growth next year after the company said in October that its underlying sales growth would “slightly exceed” the rate in 2014.

Activision Blizzard Inc reports third-quarter results. Rival Electronic Arts’ quarterly results have already revived some optimism that the long-faltering videogame sector is finally enjoying relatively steady growth thanks to the advent of the Xbox One and PS4. Activision’s offerings for the holiday quarter, however, are mainly add-ons to existing franchises such as Call of Duty and World of Warcraft, so all eyes are on the outlook. Motorola Solutions Inc is likely to report third-quarter revenue below analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine data. The company had forecast a drop in sales due to lower demand in North America, citing budget cuts and lowered government spending in the United States. Motorola is also in the process of selling its enterprise business, which makes rugged mobile computers, tablets and barcode scanners, to Zebra Technologies Corp for $3.45 billion. After the conclusion of that deal, Motorola will become further dependent on government contracts. CVS Health, which operates the No. 2 U.S. drugstore chain, is expected to report a stronger-than-expected third-quarter profit driven by growth in its pharmacy benefit management business. The loss from the company’s decision to stop selling cigarettes is expected to be offset by continued strength in its specialty pharma business.

2014-11-04,Regeneron cuts top end of eye drug sales forecast,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N0SU56820141104,"* Tightens 2014 Eylea sales forecast to $1.7 bln-1.74 bln* Adjusted third-qtr profit below estimates* To submit cholesterol-lowering drug for review by year-end* Shares down as much as 6.8 pct (Adds background, executive and analyst comment; updates shares)By Natalie GroverNov 4 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc cut the top end of its sales forecast for the blockbuster eye drug Eylea, citing slower adoption by patients with a type of diabetes-related swelling of the retina.Regeneron’s shares fell as much as 6.8 percent after the company also reported a lower-than-expected adjusted quarterly profit.The injectable drug Eylea has been one of the fastest-growing medicines in the history of biotechnology since it was approved in November 2011 to to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly.The narrowing of its forecast was a rare negative signal from Regeneron. The company expects full-year 2014 Eylea sales in the United States in a range of $1.7 billion to $1.74 billion. The upper end of the forecast had been $1.8 billion.Company executives cited a slower uptake in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), for which the drug won approval in July, than had been the case for wet AMD.Unlike wet AMD, which is typically covered by Medicare, DME sufferers are usually younger and their treatment is not necessarily covered by commercial insurers.“It’s not that we’re discouraged by the performance of the product this year,” Chief Financial Officer Robert Landy said on a post-earnings call. “It is just, in DME, it is going to take a little bit longer.”There has been little urgency to date among doctors to switch DME patients from existing treatments, as the condition is less of a threat to long-term vision than wet AMD.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt said he expected adoption in patients with DME to take off in 2015.A head-to-head study sponsored by the National Institutes of Health showed Eylea to be more effective in such patients than Roche Holding AG’s drugs Avastin and Lucentis.“So the growth driver is there,” said Butt. “Eylea’s not in trouble.”U.S. sales of Eylea rose 23 percent to $445 million for the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Regeneron also recognized $85 million from Eylea sales outside the United States, where the drug is sold by Bayer AG.Regeneron is developing other medicines with Sanofi SA , including alirocumab, an experimental cholesterol-lowering drug. Early trial data suggests it may halve the risk of heart attacks and strokes.Regeneron and Sanofi are in a race with Amgen Inc to bring this new class of medicine to market.The companies acquired a special voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc that could secure alirocumab an expedited six-month U.S. regulatory review. They said they expected to file U.S. and EU regulatory submissions by the end of 2014.The Tarrytown, New York-based company’s stock was down 6.1 percent at $371.09 around midday on Tuesday on the Nasdaq.

2014-11-06,France asks Roche for data on use of cancer drug Avastin in eye,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0IQ1LT20141106,"PARIS (Reuters) - French medicine agency ANSM has written to Roche asking the Swiss drugmaker for information on off-label uses of its cancer drug Avastin, which ANSM wants to let doctors prescribe as a cheap alternative eye treatment.French lawmakers voted in July to allow such a use of Avastin instead of Novartis and Roche’s much more expensive Lucentis, a budget-minded move that critics fear could put patients’ health - and company profits - at risk.French regulators are now in the process of gathering more data on the benefits and risks of using Avastin instead of Lucentis to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (wAMD)- a leading cause of blindness among the elderly.ANSM said the letter had been sent to Roche on Oct. 21 and that the company had three months to reply.The information provided by Roche, combined with ANSM’s own research, will be examined early next year by an ANSM “risk-benefit committee” that is expected to make its recommendations public in the first half of 2015.Roche’s Avastin is not approved by health regulators as a treatment for wAMD, but works in a similar way to the drugs currently authorized for the condition - Lucentis, marketed by Novartis and Roche, and Eylea, from Germany’s Bayer and Regeneron.France argues that encouraging the use of Avastin, which costs around 30 times less than those rival treatments, could save some 200 million euros ($250 million) annually. The move may also prompt others in Europe to follow suit.But drugmakers and some medical experts worry that allowing such off-label uses of a drug without adequate clinical trials could raise health risks, including infections.Novartis and Roche have always discouraged the substitution of Avastin for Lucentis, saying that the two drugs were developed for different therapeutic purposes.“We have received the letter regarding the evaluation process in wet AMD to be started and we will of course fully cooperate with the authorities,” a Roche spokeswoman said on Thursday. “Our position regarding the use of Avastin in wet AMD has not changed.”In its letter, made public on its website, ANSM asks Roche for any data the drugmaker has on the safety and efficacy of Avastin in wAMD or the detail of ongoing studies on the topic. It also asks Roche how it plans to monitor patients being administered Avastin for such an off-label use.ANSM chief Dominique Martin told reporters that even if Roche chose to drag its feet in the process, ANSM experts already had plenty of research on the use of Avastin in wAMD that they could build their analysis upon.An independent study published in September showed injecting Avastin into the eye did not appear to increase deaths or serious side effects and that there was no evidence to support current policies favoring Lucentis.Industry observers reckon that France’s move may spark a trend across Europe, as cash-strapped governments seek ways to contain their healthcare costs.Some doctors in the United States and Europe already use Avastin in wAMD on an unapproved basis and some pharmacies offer to split the cancer medicine into smaller doses for eye injections.Lucentis, for which a single injection can cost as much as 900 euros, was a leading reimbursement charge in France’s healthcare budget last year.If ANSM eventually decides to issue a temporary authorization to use Avastin in AMD, that authorization, called an RTU, will be valid for an extendable three-year period.Lucentis is marketed by Novartis outside the United States and is the company’s third-biggest seller, with $2.4 billion in sales last year.(1 US dollar = 0.7988 euro)"
2014-11-11,Sanofi\'s dual-action biotech asthma drug performs well in test,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0IV0U620141111,"(Reuters) - An experimental biotech drug for moderate to severe asthma from France’s Sanofi and its U.S. partner Regeneron has produced good results in clinical tests, suggesting that its dual-action mechanism may be highly effective.The encouraging data allows the companies to begin final-stage Phase III asthma trials on the medicine, which is also being developed for atopic dermatitis and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps.Dupilumab is one of the new medicines Sanofi is expected discuss at an investor day on Nov. 20 - an event that will be overshadowed by uncertainties about the company’s future after the summary dismissal of its chief executive.Dupilumab is a latecomer among a new class of antibody drugs for people whose asthma does not respond adequately to inhalers, but unlike rivals such as GlaxoSmithKline’s mepolizumab it hits two targets at once.In a mid-stage Phase IIb clinical study, dupilumab cut serious asthma attacks, known as exacerbations, by 64 to 75 percent. The Sanofi drug works by blocking two key inflammatory chemicals that drive asthma, called IL-4 and IL-13.Analysts believe that Sanofi’s product could be launched in 2019, putting it well behind GSK’s drug, which is leading the pack and has already filed for regulatory approval.Nevertheless, Berenberg Bank analyst Alistair Campbell said that dupilumab could still be a commercial success, with potential annual sales of $1.5 billion by 2025, if the strong data in current tests were replicated in final-stage Phase III studies.Other companies working on similar biotech asthma drugs include AstraZeneca, Roche and Teva."

2014-11-17,Regeneron drug highly effective for those who can\'t take statins -study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0T238Q20141117,"CHICAGO, Nov 17 (Reuters) - Regeneron Corp’s experimental drug alirocumab helped 10 times as many high-risk patients unable to tolerate widely-used statins get their “bad” LDL cholesterol down to target levels than Merck & Co’s Zetia, according to data from a clinical trial presented on Monday.Alirocumab, developed along with French drugmaker Sanofi , belongs to a new class of potent drugs that block a naturally occurring protein called PCSK9 that prevents the liver from removing LDL from the blood.Patients in the 360-subject study, called Odyssey Alternative, on average had LDL levels above 190 and all were deemed statin intolerant due to muscle and skeletal side effects when taking the popular medicines.After 24 weeks of treatment, alirocumab lowered LDL by 45 percent compared with 14.6 percent for Zetia (ezetimibe).Importantly, 42 percent of alirocumab patients got LDL down to target levels versus 4 percent for Zetia. That rose to 51 percent versus 6 when excluding those who didn’t complete 24 weeks of treatment. Target goals were for LDL under 70 for very high-risk patients and under 100 for high-risk patients.“It’s a more potent and more effective lipid lowering drug, getting patients to goal by a 10-fold higher amount. It just blows (Zetia) away,” said Dr. Patrick Moriarty, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the results at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in Chicago.Zetia is used to lower LDL in patients who cannot take highly effective statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor. They are among the most likely candidates for PCSK9 inhibitors once approved.Curiously, during a four-week preliminary period when all patients were just getting a placebo, 47 dropped out, including 25 complaining of muscular side effects.During the actual treatment period, 18.3 percent of alirocumab patients, 25 percent on Zetia and 25.4 percent who were given Lipitor in a third group discontinued treatment.In an ongoing extension of the trial, with patients aware of what they were taking, the alirocumab discontinuation rate from muscular side effects fell dramatically.That most patients given Lipitor stayed on therapy calls into question their actual statin intolerance.“This shows you the complexity of diagnosing statin intolerance,” Moriarty said. “This population is not simple.”Regeneron and Sanofi expect to apply for U.S. and European approval this year. But a patent infringement lawsuit filed by Amgen over its rival drug could complicate that. (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Nick Zieminski)"

2014-11-20,Sanofi touts new drugs but diabetes outlook disappoints,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0J40LB20141120,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi, which sacked its chief executive three weeks ago, gave a weak sales outlook for its diabetes drugs on Thursday, overshadowing plans to reap more than 30 billion euros ($38 billion) from new medicines.The French drugmaker said it aimed to launch up to 18 new drugs by the end of 2020 and told investors it was working hard to find the best possible successor to ex-CEO Chris Viehbacher.“There is a driver in the seat even in this interim period,” said Chairman Serge Weinberg, who has taken the helm while Sanofi looks for a new boss. He restated that investors should not expect any change in the group’s strategy.Investors are concerned about Sanofi’s management and financial prospects since the drugmaker warned last month that sales of its popular Lantus insulin were slowing more sharply than expected. The board subsequently sacked CEO Viehbacher over his go-it-alone management style.Thursday’s long-planned investor event focused on drugs expected to launch in the coming years, including the world’s first vaccine against dengue fever, the injectable cholesterol-lowering drug alirocumab and the allergy treatment dupilumab.“I would not trade this pipeline with anybody else’s pipeline,” said Sanofi head of research Elias Zerhouni, quashing speculation that Viehbacher’s ouster might tempt him to leave.Sanofi expects to launch up to six new medicines in 2015 alone and about one every six months between 2016 and 2018. It hopes the launches will help mitigate its dependence on Lantus, the world’s most prescribed insulin and its top-selling drug.Sanofi and its partner Regeneron also said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had granted a fast-track development and review process to dupilumab in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, a chronic form of eczema.Sanofi had previously said it would not give more detailed financial guidance before annual results in February.But it warned on Thursday that its diabetes business, which accounts for more than a fifth of group revenue, would post little or no growth between 2015 and 2018, sending its shares down 3.5 percent by 1500 GMT.Sanofi’s forecast assumes a substantial conversion of patients from Lantus to an improved version of the drug, Toujeo, continued sales growth in emerging markets and U.S. launches of new diabetes drugs including inhaled insulin Afrezza.Leerink analyst Seamus Fernandez said the downbeat assessment for diabetes sales and the fact Sanofi was banking on substantial patient switching to Toujeo was below his assumed sales growth of 2 percent over the period.Diabetes drugs, a market expanding worldwide as obesity increases, has long been Sanofi’s cash cow but the drugmaker’s pricing power is set to shrink as so-called biosimilar copies enter the market over the next two years."
2014-11-20,"Sanofi, Regeneron eczema drug gets FDA fast-track designation",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFWN0T901G20141120,"PARIS, Nov 20 (Reuters) - Sanofi and its U.S. partner Regeneron said on Thursday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had designated their dupilumab drug as “breakthrough therapy” in the treatment of atopic dermatitis, a chronic form of eczema, granting the product a fast-track development and review process.Dupilumab is also being studied in the treatment of asthma and chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps and is seen by both companies and financial analysts as a potential blockbuster.It is one of the new medicines Sanofi will discuss at an investor day later on Thursday - an event likely to be overshadowed by uncertainties about the company’s future after the summary dismissal of its chief executive last month.

2014-11-21,New data fuels doctors\' demands to rewrite U.S. heart guidelines,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0T91S320141121,"CHICAGO, Nov 21 (Reuters) - Controversial heart disease prevention guidelines that abandoned specific targets for reducing “bad” LDL cholesterol are under fresh assault after a major study highlighted the benefits of taking LDL to very low levels.Guidelines issued last year by the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology asked doctors to assess individual patients’ risk for heart disease over 10 years based on a complex calculation of risks posed by lifestyle, family history and other health conditions. Those deemed at sufficient risk would be prescribed cholesterol-lowering statins.The recommendation overturned decades of practice in which doctors screened patients for high cholesterol, then sought to reduce LDL to a specific level. Many cardiologists criticized the guidelines, saying they were confusing, and that patients and physicians were comfortable with measurable goals to reduce the risk of heart disease, the world’s No. 1 killer.Those opponents got a boost from data released on Monday showing high-risk patients fared better when their LDL was brought to very low levels by adding Merck & Co’s Zetia to treatment with a statin.Several prominent heart specialists told Reuters the guidelines should be changed, with some advocating LDL targets even lower than previous ones. Many have ignored the year-old recommendations.“I never really bought the new guidelines,” said Dr. Andrew Klaus of Mount Carmel Health System in Columbus, Ohio. The Zetia trial “definitely showed that lower is better,” he said. “I would predict the guidelines are going to be rewritten very soon.”The so-called Improve-It trial of Merck’s Zetia, unveiled at the AHA’s annual meeting in Chicago, studied more than 18,000 high-risk patients. It showed they could further cut heart attacks and strokes by taking LDL cholesterol from about 70 to around 53.Dr. Steven Nissen, cardiology chief at the Cleveland Clinic, said the result “blows up” the prevention guidelines.“It matters how low you go (with LDL) ... which is why many of us were so upset about the guidelines,” Nissen told Reuters. At a recent meeting of cardiologists and primary care doctors, Nissen asked how many had adopted the guidelines.“Three out of those 300 raised their hand,” he said. “Nobody is using them.”‘SCIENTIFIC TOMES’Millions of Americans at risk of heart disease could be affected by the outcome of the debate. Some 83.6 million live with some form or cardiovascular disease or the effects of stroke, according to the AHA.By some estimates, the new guidelines would boost the use of high-potency statins such as AstraZeneca’s Crestor and Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, now available as cheaper generic atorvastatin.The debate could also affect the future of new medicines from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc that reduce LDL even more aggressively.In Reuters interviews with more than a dozen cardiologists attending the AHA meeting, most said they were wrestling with the guidelines.AHA and ACC officials have heard the complaints and said the guidelines are subject to revision based on new scientific data.“We don’t want guidelines that serve as scientific tomes that nobody finds useful,” said Dr. Robert Harrington, an AHA board member. “We need our guidelines to really help guide practice.”When a major trial like Improve-It comes out, “AHA absolutely responds to that,” he said.Dr. Patrick O’Gara, president of the ACC, said the new guidelines were based on the fact that clinical trials of cholesterol-lowering statin drugs were not designed to test the effectiveness of specific cholesterol targets - only the drugs themselves. Doctors following the guidelines tend to test cholesterol levels far less frequently, and that has some in the field worried.“We’re still having this back and forth, which seems to represent a gap between the manner in which trials were designed and the practical implications,” O’Gara said. “I hope we will be able to strike the right balance in the process.”Dr. Lori Mosca of New York-Presbyterian Hospital, who helps train residents, said she is frequently asked how to interpret the guidelines.“There is sufficient confusion out there that it’s worthy of clarifying what the message is,” she said.Dr. Matthew Sorrentino, a preventive cardiologist at University of Chicago Medicine, uses the guidelines. But he said the older targets - an LDL of 70 for high-risk patients - were easier for doctors and patients to grasp.“Almost everybody knew what the LDL target was,” he said. “I can see making the guidelines easier to follow.”Writers of the guidelines, such as Dr. Donald Lloyd-Jones of Northwestern Medicine in Chicago, defended the scientific rigor behind them. He said focusing on a cholesterol goal may have led to undertreatment, perhaps failing to take into account the added risks from diabetes, obesity or smoking.A new class of drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, that can lower LDL by more than 50 percent may increase the pressure for new, even lower, LDL targets, some doctors said. One from Amgen and another developed by Regeneron and Sanofi are expected to reach the market next year and initially be used in patients with extremely high cholesterol or those who cannot tolerate statins.“We can’t really get away from paying attention to what the LDL is,” said Dr. Daniel Rader, director of the preventive cardiology program at the University of Pennsylvania.

2014-12-15,German watchdog deals another setback to Bayer eye drug Eylea,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0TZ2DD20141215,"FRANKFURT, Dec 15 (Reuters) - Bayer’s eye medication Eylea does not offer an advantage over a rival product from Novartis when treating patients with a type of diabetes-related swelling of the retina, a German healthcare cost watchdog said on Monday.The opinion issued by the German Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care, or IQWiG, could affect the level of reimbursement by public insurers for Eylea in Germany.IQWiG compared trial data on Eylea and Novartis’s Lucentis for treatment of diabetic macular edema (DME) and found there was no relevant difference between the two, neither in terms of how well patients could see nor in terms of side effects.IQWiG’s opinions are taken into account by Germany’s medical cost-benefit agency G-BA, which is due to publish an assessment of Eylea’s cost-effectiveness in March.The watchdog has in the past come to similar conclusions on Eylea to treat other eye conditions. In January, it said it was unable to assess whether Eylea was more effective than Lucentis, sold by Roche in the United States and by Novartis elsewhere, to treat macular edema.And last year, it said it could not assess possible advantages of Eylea to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, because Bayer had not provided relevant data.Bayer said it would respond to IQWiG’s assessment, adding it was convinced of Eylea’s benefit to patients.The drugmaker has said it expects Eylea, also known as VEGF Trap-Eye, to generate more than 1.5 billion euros ($1.9 billion) in peak annual sales, up from 333 million last year.Bayer HealthCare and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals are collaborating in Eylea’s development."
2014-12-23,"Dow ends above 18,000 for first time on strong GDP report",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0K10YW20141223,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks rose on Tuesday, with the Dow closing above 18,000 for the first time ever and the S&P 500 ending at a record after an unexpectedly strong report on economic growth.The Nasdaq ended modestly lower, pressured by the biggest selloff in biotech names in many months, while trading was light ahead of the Christmas holiday. Markets will close early on Wednesday and will be closed all of Thursday.Both the Dow and S&P 500 hit intraday records in their fifth-straight day of gains. The Dow rose as high as 18,069.22 and is up about 175 percent from a 12-year closing low hit on March 9, 2009. The S&P’s record close was its 51st such record this year.The final estimate for third-quarter U.S. economic growth was revised up to a 5 percent annual pace, its quickest in 11 years and easily topping expectations for growth of 4.3 percent.“Everyone is surprised, and I’m definitely pleased,” said Wayne Kaufman, chief market analyst at Phoenix Financial Services in New York. “But the question is, how can inflation be so low when GDP is so high? Either this is just a one-off and GDP will fall back dramatically, or we’ll see a pickup in inflation, which could put more pressure on the Fed.”The report spurred a broad rally, with nine of the ten primary S&P 500 sectors higher on the day. The only group to fall was healthcare .SPXHC, down 2.2 percent alongside a massive drop in biotech stocks.The Nasdaq biotech index .NBI fell 4.6 percent, its biggest one-day decline since April 10.

2014-2-06,Sanofi shares dip on drugmaker\'s timid rebound forecast,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0LB0NI20140206,"* Sees 2014 earnings 4-7 pct higher than in 2013* Raises dividend to 2.80 euros from 2.77 euros* Q4 net income up 16.8 pct to 1.81 bln euros* CEO still sees strong growth in emerging markets* Shares fall to one-year low, guidance disappointsBy Natalie HuetPARIS, Feb 6 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi’s forecast for a return to profit growth after three years of decline failed to impress investors on Thursday, sending its shares to a one-year low.Sanofi last year suffered three straight quarters of falling net income, two profit warnings and several product setbacks, but it is now shaking off the impact of patent losses and betting on continued growth in its diabetes and rare diseases businesses and in emerging markets.Though the announcement of an increased full-year dividend and a forecast for this year’s earnings to grow by between 4 percent and 7 percent represent a marked improvement from the 9.6 percent drop recorded in 2013, analysts had expected more.“We had hoped for a guidance range that would bracket double-digit growth, so that is disappointing. Nevertheless, Sanofi may have learned its lessons from 2013 and be guiding conservatively,” Berenberg analysts wrote in a note.Shares in Sanofi - France’s second-largest listed company behind oil major Total - were down 2.7 percent at 1447 GMT, the worst performer on the Euro Stoxx Healthcare Index and on France’s CAC 40 index.Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher told reporters Sanofi is now beyond its so-called patent cliff, with no major drugs losing protection this year, and had successfully revamped its research and development (R&D) to be able to launch new, harder-to-copy biologic drugs in the years ahead.Drugmakers worldwide have been struggling with patent expiries as well as cutbacks in healthcare spending by cash-strapped European governments. In the search for growth, Sanofi turned to rare diseases, emerging markets, over-the-counter treatments, animal health and generics.To squeeze more out of R&D spending, it cut jobs in French laboratories, saying that in-house research was not sufficiently productive. It has also strengthened ties with Regeneron and Alnylam to replenish its product pipeline.Last year was marred by inventory and manufacturing glitches in Brazil and Canada, a growth-stifling crackdown on sales practices in China and several drug setbacks, including a U.S. red light for multiple sclerosis drug Lemtrada.There were also some successes, such as the approval of Sanofi’s other MS drug, Aubagio, in Europe and the United States, as well as encouraging clinical results for new drugs for cholesterol (alirocumab), rheumatoid arthritis (sarilumab) and diabetes (U300).Sanofi said that generic competition cut 1.25 billion euros from its sales of key legacy drugs in the United States and Europe last year.Its top-selling diabetes drug Lantus, sales of which rose 20 percent this year on strong pricing in the United States, will lose patent protection there in February 2015. Its most serious challenger is a biosimilar drug made by Eli Lilly, but that is likely stay off U.S. shelves until 2016 because Sanofi is suing the company for patent infringement.In the meantime, Viehbacher said the company would bank on its broad geographic spread to boost performance despite economic uncertainty in emerging markets, which account for a third of its sales.The depreciation of the U.S. dollar, Japanese yen, Brazilian real, South African rand and other currencies against the euro cut 5.2 percentage points from sales growth last year.Sanofi said that it would raise its 2013 dividend to 2.80 euros per share, from 2.77 euros the previous year, and that it expects this year’s earnings per share to grow by 4-7 percent at constant exchange rates.Asked what revenue growth it expects in emerging markets, Viehbacher said: “We’re not going to give a forecast for 2014 at that granular level, but the potential for double-digit growth is certainly there despite the turbulence.”He pointed to favourable demographics and the emergence of a large middle class in countries such as China and India, noting that “people don’t stop getting sick because the GDP has suddenly declined”.Fourth-quarter net income rose to 1.81 billion euros ($2.45 billion), up 30.5 percent at constant exchange rates, while sales reached 8.46 billion euros, up 6.5 percent at constant exchange rates.The average forecast from analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S was for quarterly sales of 8.4 billion euros and net income of 1.77 billion."
2014-2-11,Regeneron forecasts strong Eylea sales; shares rise,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0LG2WJ20140211,"Feb 11 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc forecast U.S. sales of eye drug Eylea to reach $1.7-$1.8 billion in 2014 as it expects the drug to win approval for newer uses, sending its shares up 3 percent before the opening bell.Regeneron, whose stock has been propelled by the success of Eylea, said U.S. sales of the sight-saving drug rose 46 percent to $402 million in the fourth quarter. The drug’s international sales touched $184 million in the quarter.Eylea is used to treat wet age-related macular edema - the leading cause of blindness in the elderly. It is marketed by Bayer AG in Europe.Since its launch in late 2011, Eylea has become one of the fastest-growing drugs in the history of biotechnology, grabbing market share from rivals such as Roche AG’s Lucentis.The drug is also being evaluated in a late-stage study for use in diabetic macular edema (DME) and macular edema following branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).The jump in Eylea sales lifted revenue but the company’s fourth-quarter earnings fell short of analysts’ estimates due to significantly higher operating expenses.The company’s net income fell to $97 million, or 86 cents per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31, from $470 million, or $4.08 per share, a year earlier. The year-ago quarter included a non-cash tax benefit of $336 million.Analysts had expected a profit of 98 cents per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue jumped 47 percent to $610.4 million, helped by collaboration revenue from partner Bayer. Expenses rose 48 percent during the quarter.Regeneron shares rose about 3 percent to $311.50 in premarket trading on Tuesday.

2014-2-11,Sanofi use of cash scrutinised as L\'Oreal stake buyback fades,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0LG1ZM20140211,"* L’Oreal does not need to sell Sanofi stake for Nestle deal* Hopes recede for debt-funded buyback of stake by Sanofi* Sanofi may still proceed with separate buyback - analysts* Drugmaker may also lift holding in U.S. biotech RegeneronBy Natalie HuetPARIS, Feb 11 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi will face market scrutiny over what it plans to do with its cash as the prospect of a massive buyback of its shares held by L’Oreal fades.French cosmetics firm L’Oreal and Nestle loosened a 40-year partnership on Tuesday when L’Oreal said it would buy 8 percent of its capital for 6.5 billion euros ($9 billion) from the Swiss food group - but did not need to sell any of its Sanofi shares to fund the deal.L’Oreal thus remains Sanofi’s biggest shareholder with a stake of close to 9 percent, worth about $12 billion, and its Chief Executive Jean-Paul Agon told a conference call that L’Oreal was “very happy” with that situation.Shares in Sanofi dropped nearly 2 percent after the deal was announced, reflecting disappointment over the lost opportunity for the drugmaker to proceed with a debt-funded share buyback that would have substantially boosted its earnings per share.They later recovered to stand unchanged by 1145 GMT.Deutsche Bank analyst Mark Clark said buying back L’Oreal’s 9 percent stake would increase Sanofi’s earnings per share by 6 to 8 percent. It remains unclear whether L’Oreal will buy back more of Nestle’s holding in the future, he said, noting that this would likely require selling down the Sanofi stake.It was disappointing for the market that L’Oreal will only buy back some of the Nestle stake - for which it did not need to sell Sanofi shares - and it seemed to signal an intention to retain its Sanofi holding over the long run, he said.“It doesn’t rule anything out in the future, but people will conclude it reduces the chances of Sanofi buying back that 9 percent stake in due course,” Clark said.For the time being, the news increases pressure on Sanofi to clearly state what it plans to do with its cash pile, said Berenberg analyst Alistair Campbell.“I think Sanofi would preferably like to invest in bolt-on acquisitions to strengthen the business - they’ve always been clear on that front - but I also think you could well see them at some stage commit to a share buyback of their own,” he said.Campbell expects Sanofi to have 3 billion euros in excess cash this year and to use 2 billion to launch a share buyback programme unrelated to the fate of L’Oreal’s holding.Citi analysts, meanwhile, say that Sanofi could pump the free cash into new partnerships with biotechs, such as the deal it recently struck with U.S. company Alnylam, as it strives to refill its pipeline after many patent expiries.Sanofi has consistently said it aimed to spend 1 to 2 billion euros each year on bolt-on acquisitions. But Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher said during the company’s quarterly results last Thursday that the sky-high price tags of biotech companies with late-stage drugs in their pipeline made acquisitions hard to justify.In the meantime, analysts say Sanofi might prefer deals where it can gradually increase its stake in a company depending on how its drugs fare in clinical trials.Sanofi has hinted in the past that it could use its cash to raise its stake in U.S. company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , its partner on several promising products, including a potential multi-billion dollar cholesterol drug.Viehbacher said in September Sanofi could look at raising its stake in Regeneron from about 16 percent to as much as 30 percent.Raising its stake in Regeneron beyond the 20 percent threshold and consolidating related income would cost Sanofi 1 billion euros but would boost earnings by 3 percent from 2015, Citi analyst Peter Verdult wrote.A spokeswoman for Sanofi noted the company had bought back more than 1.6 billion euros of shares in 2013 but she declined to comment on the L’Oreal-Nestle deal or on Sanofi’s future use of cash."

2014-3-10,European Factors to Watch-Shares seen down; focus on miners,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0M70BV20140310,"LONDON, March 10 (Reuters) - European shares are expected to extend the previous session’s steep losses on Monday, with miners seen hit by weak Chinese economic data, which revived concerns about slowing growth in the country, the world’s biggest consumer of industrial metals.Investors, already jittery due to tension in Ukraine, where Russian forces seized another border post and a military airfield, faced weekend data from China showing a surprisingly sharp drop in exports, which tipped the country’s trade balance into a deficit.“The data comes on the heels of the first Chinese corporate bond default, and clearly raises questions over the health of the world’s second-largest economy,” Keith Bowman, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said.“The UK’s FTSE 100 index remains particularly vulnerable, given its high weighting in global mining stocks.

2014-3-18,Rivals race to develop new biotech asthma drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2H10520140318,"LONDON (Reuters) - Rival firms are racing to develop injectable biotech asthma drugs for patients with severe disease who don’t respond well to traditional inhalers, in pursuit of a new market worth a possible $7.5 billion.Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline, the leader in asthma treatments since launching its Ventolin inhaler in 1969, is in the vanguard but faces competition from the likes of Roche, AstraZeneca, Sanofi and Teva.Despite treatment advances in recent decades, asthma is still not well controlled in up to 20 percent of patients on standard therapy, which consists of inhaled steroids and long-acting beta agonists that are designed to open the airways.This patient group includes many with severe disease, thought to number around 2 million in leading industrialized nations, according to consultancy Decision Resources.Novel antibody-based drugs now nearing the market offer a way to get to the root of the problem by targeting key inflammatory chemicals made in the body that drive asthma. They are already being hailed by doctors as a major advance.“I’m very optimistic about the new drugs,” said Elisabeth Bel, president-elect of the European Respiratory Society and head of respiratory medicine at the Academic Medical Center in Amsterdam.“We have participated in several trials with the new biological agents and have seen some amazing results.”In particular, the new injectable medicines have led to reductions in serious asthma attacks, known as exacerbations, of around 40 to 60 percent in clinical trials.The threat of such attacks - which may require hospital treatment and can sometimes be life-threatening - dominate the lives of people with severe asthma and represent a big financial burden to healthcare systems providing emergency care.Significantly, the new drugs offer a more personalized approach to asthma care, with patients undergoing so-called “biomarker” blood tests to check if they are likely to respond to the medicines.This targeted approach is gaining traction in many medical fields, most notably cancer. It is attractive to governments and insurers who pay for healthcare, since it means drugs should only go to patients who are likely to benefit.“Severe asthma patients represent the majority of the (asthma) burden on healthcare systems and budgets,” said Bahija Jallal, head of AstraZeneca’s MedImmune biotech unit, which is investing in a broad portfolio of medicines for the condition.“We will be working to convince payers this is something that brings value.”Coupled with the money hospitals could save from a big drop in exacerbations, this leads many analysts to argue that companies will be able to charge a high price for the new drugs.Barclays analysts, for example, assume a price of around $15,000 a year for GSK’s new drug mepolizumab, which is set to be submitted for regulatory approval later this year following positive late-stage study results last week.Seamus Fernandez of Leerink, who predicts the market for severe asthma biotech drugs could exceed $7.5 billion a year in the United States and Europe alone, is more cautious and expects a price tag of something under $10,000, reflecting an increasingly competitive landscape.That would be a modest discount to the price of Xolair, from Novartis and Roche, which is the only biotech asthma drug sold at present, but which works in a different way to the new batch of products and is only indicated for allergic asthma.Some doctors are wary about the pricing environment.“I think cost is going to be a hurdle. Payers are going to have to figure out whether they are going to allow multiple patients to be on multiple biologics,” said Michael Wechsler, an asthma specialist at National Jewish Health in Denver.Although the number of patients with severe asthma is small, there are at least five known disease sub-types, depending on which precise biological pathways are driving the condition.Working out the right drug for the right patient is therefore going to be a challenge, according to Wechsler, who believes there is still more work to be done on tests, since biomarker signals can be transient within individual patients, depending on their condition and medicines they are taking.Analysts reckon GSK is two years ahead of rivals with its drug to block the action of inflammatory chemical interleukin-5 (IL-5), with competition coming from AstraZeneca and Teva.But IL-5 is not the only game in town. Experimental products from Sanofi, working with Regeneron, and Roche target two chemicals known as IL-4 and IL-13, which might have an even greater impact.GSK hopes to get a commercial edge by being ahead of the pack, but the company acknowledges that picking the right drug for the right patient will not be straightforward.“There will be some overlap where some patients could be effectively treated with one or more drug, but there are likely to be others who are only effectively treated with one type. It’s still early days to sort through all of that,” said Steve Yancy, GSK’s development leader for mepolizumab."

The report was the latest in a string of positive reads on the economy that supported theories that softness early this year was related to bad weather and not weakening fundamentals.Investors continued to watch global issues cautiously. On Monday, major indexes fell on concerns that the crisis in Ukraine could escalate, pushing traders to take profits in such high-flying sectors as biotech and Internet shares. Those names rebounded on Tuesday, with some of Monday’s biggest decliners topping the list of advancing S&P 500 names.Biotech shares snapped a four-day losing streak to rise 1.7 percent. Alexion Pharma rose 2.4 percent to $153.29, while Regeneron Pharma was up 2 percent at $312.41. Among Internet names, which have also been hit by accusations that they are overpriced, Facebook Inc added 2.1 percent to $64.97.The rebound in some so-called “momentum” names was an indication that while concerns persist about geopolitical tensions in Ukraine and slowing growth in China, investors are not so bearish on equities as to sell them wholesale. The CBOE Volatility Index, a gauge of investor anxiety, fell 5.6 percent and remains at historically low levels.“Investors become momentarily concerned about valuation, but that pullback was healthy, and we could see modest gains from here just because equities remain the most attractive place to be,” said Kristina Hooper, head of portfolio strategies at Allianz Global Investors in New York, which has $475 billion in assets under management.“Biotechs continue to look attractive since they offer a higher level of growth, and in face they look more attractive than they did because valuations improved in the selloff.”McCormick & Co and Walgreen Co were the S&P 500’s two biggest gainers after reporting quarterly results.

The biggest advancing sectors were healthcare and telecom, two groups that are considered defensive plays.Russia and the West drew a tentative line under the Ukraine crisis after U.S. President Barack Obama and his allies agreed to hold off on more damaging economic sanctions unless Moscow goes beyond the seizure of Crimea, as Russian President Vladimir Putin last week said he didn’t want to do.The development seemed to limit the odds that the biggest East-West conflict since the Cold War could escalate further, removing a potential headwind from markets. While few U.S. companies have direct exposure to the region, investors had been worried about any fallout from prolonged tensions.“I would be shocked if there was any kind of escalation now, which eliminates some of the concerns people had and forces the market to focus back on the economy, where recent data has been lending credence to the theory that some recent issues were related to weather, not fundamentals,” said Malcolm Polley, president and chief investment officer of Stewart Capital Advisors in Indiana, Pennsylvania.Orders for durable goods rose more than expected in February, ending two straight months of declines. Separately, private-sector economic activity accelerated in March at a faster clip than in February as the services sector picked up, according to financial data firm Markit’s preliminary composite Purchasing Managers Index.Facebook Inc said late Tuesday it would buy Oculus VR Inc, a maker of virtual-reality glasses for gaming, for $2 billion. The acquisition follows Facebook’s $19 billion deal to buy WhatsApp in February. Shares of the social networking giant fell 2.4 percent to $63.38.Shares of King Digital Entertainment Plc, maker of the wildly popular “Candy Crush Saga” game, fell 9.5 percent to $20.31 in its trading debut on Wednesday, after the company’s initial public offering valued it at about $6 billion.

2014-3-29,Amgen drug lowers cholesterol up to 66 percent in pivotal studies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA2S0IF20140329,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s drug from a high profile new class of experimental medicines lowered “bad” LDL cholesterol by 55 percent to 66 percent compared with a placebo in a trio of late-stage clinical trials, according to data presented on Saturday.Amgen had previously said the drug, evolocumab, met the main goals of five late-stage trials involving some 4,000 patients by significantly outperforming placebo or another cholesterol medicine in a variety of patient populations.Saturday’s presentation at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington marked the first time the magnitude of LDL lowering and other details from the late stage studies were unveiled. Results of the other two Phase III studies will be presented at the meeting on Sunday.The data also showed that two dosing regimens of the injected drug - 140 milligrams every two weeks or 420 mg once a month - were equally effective in reducing LDL levels.“We’re seeing excellent efficacy and the safety profile appears no different than placebo, so you can’t get better than that,” Dr. Michael Koren, one of the lead investigators on two of the evolocumab studies, said in a telephone interview.Evolocumab belongs to a highly promising class of drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that reduces the liver’s ability to remove LDL from the blood. They are expected to be used in patients who cannot tolerate widely used and highly effective statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, and in those unable to get their cholesterol levels low enough using currently available medicines.“In terms of the LDL lowering, these drugs are as good or better than anything we have,” said Koren, who presented data from the trial called Mendel-2 at the ACC meeting.In that 614-patient study, evolocumab reduced LDL 55-57 percent more than a placebo and up to 40 percent more than Merck & Co’s cholesterol fighter Zetia in patients not on any other cholesterol drugs.It also helped about 70 percent of patients get their LDL down to 70 or lower, Koren said. That had been the target for high risk patients before controversial new guidelines announced last year eliminated specific target numbers.Amgen said it will file its application seeking U.S. approval of evolocumab sometime this year. The drug is expected to compete with similar medicines also in late stages of development from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi and from Pfizer.Analysts have forecast eventual annual sales of $3 billion or more for each of the drugs, assuming insurers agree to pay for them. Some industry analysts expect them to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the costs of statins.The companies are conducting large, so-called outcomes studies to prove that the new medicines reduce heart attacks and strokes, as statins have, in addition to dramatically lowering LDL levels. The FDA has indicated that it would not necessarily wait for results from those years-long trials to approve the drugs.Earlier this month, the FDA asked companies developing PCSK9 inhibitors to assess potential cognitive impairment side effects that have been reported with some cholesterol drugs.“I can tell you in Medel-2 there was no (cognitive impairment) signal whatsoever,” said Koren, chief executive of the Jacksonville Center for Clinical Research in Florida.Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s executive medical director for global development, said the same has been true of other evolocumab studies.“We’ve looked at our data very, very carefully and are continuing to look at it very carefully in combination with the FDA. We haven’t seen any (neurocognitive) safety signals,” Wasserman said in a telephone interview.In the study called Descartes, a 52-week trial of 901 patients already on statins or other lipid lowering medicines, evolocumab on average lowered LDL by 57 percent versus placebo.The 329-patient, 12-week Rutherford-2 study tested the Amgen drug in subjects with familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition involving extreme, dangerously high cholesterol. For those patients, who were already on statins and other lipid lowering therapies, evolocumab took down LDL levels by 59-66 percent compared with placebo.Koren said he expects the first PCSK9 approvals to come for that patient population with additional approvals to follow for those who can’t take statins.“It’s really the most exciting story since statins, no question, and I think that’s pretty universally held in the preventive cardiology community,” Koren said."
2014-4-04,Momentum names may see more pain,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA3401320140405,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - After their worst week in several years, high-flying stocks that defied gravity throughout 2013 look like they’re in for more punishment. The reason: Despite the plunge, they still look overvalued.Familiar names such as Netflix, Facebook and Tesla Motors, along with a number of biotechnology and cloud-computing stocks, have been pummeled in the last month. Some stocks are down more than 20 percent over that period, falling into their own bear market, and yet their valuations still far exceed those of the broader U.S. stock indexes. Wall Street defines a bear market as a drop of 20 percent or more from a recent peak.Facebook Inc FB.O, for example, has fallen nearly 22 percent from an intraday record reached less than a month ago. The stock was still up nearly 3.8 percent for the year at Friday's close. Among biotech names, Alexion Pharmaceuticals ALXN.O has declined 23 percent from a February 25 intraday high, and yet the stock on Friday was still up 7 percent for the year.Facebook still traded on Friday at a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 20, making it the most expensive in the S&P 500, which has an overall price-to-sales ratio of 1.7. The other companies with expensive valuations read like a Who's Who of so-called momentum stocks, including Regeneron REGN.O, Alexion, TripAdvisor and Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX.O.“There’s value somewhere, but since these things aren’t being traded off typical valuations, you can’t go by those metrics, and it’s more about when do you find that stability,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.The price-to-sales ratio is the way to value a stock by looking at its market capitalization in comparison to its sales over a 12-month period.The declines have come at a time when investors overall are seeing a general improvement in economic figures, including Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data, which showed strong job gains in March and more people moving into the labor force.On Friday, the Nasdaq lost more than 100 points even though the S&P 500 briefly touched another intraday record.Expectations for earnings have come down for the first quarter, but investors are hoping for an improved outlook for most of the S&P 500. That may cause the rotation away from hyper-growth to steady growth to continue.Earnings season begins next week with reports from Bed Bath & Beyond BBBY.O, Wells Fargo & Co WFC.N and JPMorgan Chase & Co JPM.N.First-quarter S&P 500 companies’ earnings are projected to have increased just 1.2 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed. The forecast is down sharply from the start of the year, when growth was estimated at 6.5 percent.“I’m not concerned about this spilling over to the broader market. We’ve been in a trading range, finding resistance at record levels, so this isn’t cause for alarm,” said David Joy, chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial in Boston, where he helps oversee $703 billion in assets under management.“I think there are bargains to be found, just not in the names that are getting hit. Financials are attractive here, as are industrials. The more mature tech names, especially on the software side, look valuable,” he said.The interest in speculative plays hasn't entirely eroded. Four different companies made their debuts on U.S. exchanges on Friday, and all four ended their first day higher, with the most notable being online food delivery service GrubHub Inc GRUB.N, which shot up 31 percent.However, for those concerned that the selling in biotech, Internet retail and other trading-crowd favorites will spill over to the rest of the market, Friday was a bit worrisome.

The reason: Despite the plunge, they still look overvalued.Familiar names such as Netflix, Facebook and Tesla Motors, along with a number of biotechnology and cloud-computing stocks, have been pummeled in the last month. Some stocks are down more than 20 percent over that period, falling into their own bear market, and yet their valuations still far exceed those of the broader U.S. stock indexes. Wall Street defines a bear market as a drop of 20 percent or more from a recent peak.Facebook Inc, for example, has fallen nearly 22 percent from an intraday record reached less than a month ago. The stock was still up nearly 3.8 percent for the year at Friday’s close. Among biotech names, Alexion Pharmaceuticals has declined 23 percent from a Feb. 25 intraday high, and yet the stock on Friday was still up 7 percent for the year.Facebook still traded on Friday at a price-to-sales ratio of nearly 20, making it the most expensive in the S&P 500, which has an overall price-to-sales ratio of 1.7. The other companies with expensive valuations read like a Who’s Who of so-called momentum stocks, including Regeneron, Alexion, TripAdvisor and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.“There’s value somewhere, but since these things aren’t being traded off typical valuations, you can’t go by those metrics, and it’s more about when do you find that stability,” said Mike O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut.The price-to-sales ratio is the way to value a stock by looking at its market capitalization in comparison to its sales over a 12-month period.The declines have come at a time when investors overall are seeing a general improvement in economic figures, including Friday’s nonfarm payrolls data, which showed strong job gains in March and more people moving into the labor force.On Friday, the Nasdaq lost more than 100 points even though the S&P 500 briefly touched another intraday record.Expectations for earnings have come down for the first quarter, but investors are hoping for an improved outlook for most of the S&P 500.

2014-4-24,Trend-setter Apple\'s stock split could bring out the copycats,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0NG1CU20140424,"NEW YORK, April 24 (Reuters) - Apple has long been a trend-setter whose hot products attract imitators, and now its recent stock split might help revive a trend from the 1990s that has all but disappeared on Wall Street.On Wednesday, the iPad maker and largest U.S. company by market value said it would do a seven-for-one split, knocking its share price down from the $500-plus level to something closer to $75. The stock is up 8 percent on Thursday.It becomes the fourth member of the S&P 500 to announce a split in 2014. That is a pretty paltry pace when compared with the late 90s, when nearly 100 companies split their stock to attract more investors. Apple Inc’s move might inspire others, some believe, but only modestly.“It could become a bit of a trend when you see a name like Apple decide to split the stock,” said Ken Polcari, director of the NYSE floor division at O’Neil Securities.Polcari said Priceline Group Inc, the most expensive single stock on the S&P 500, is a prime candidate. Other pricey stocks such as Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc, trading above $500, or Amazon.com Inc, above $300, could follow.“You get stocks like Priceline that trade above $1,200 - maybe they’ll look at this, see the excitement it generates and decide to do the same thing,” Polcari said. “Google also sticks out there as a potential name that could be split with no problem.”Stock splits do not change the value of the company, one reason why Apple CEO Tim Cook said just two years ago that a split does “nothing.”That is a view many corporate managers shared in recent years, as the institutional investors who own the vast majority of shares are not concerned about individual share prices.According to Standard & Poor’s, in every year between 1997 and 1999 at least 90 S&P components split their stock. After the dot-com bubble burst, splits went out of favor and have become uncommon. There have been just 75 splits since 2008.Cook now feels differently, saying on Wednesday that the company was taking the action “to make Apple stock more accessible to a larger number of investors.”Apple currently carries the third-highest price in the S&P 500, behind Priceline’s $1,219.95 and Graham Holdings Co’s $690.68. In the broader S&P 1500 Composite Index , there are 26 companies trading at $200 or more a share, including well-known names such as Visa Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.Some money managers think Apple’s move will bring out more splits.“I think other companies will follow suit because it’s difficult to buy round lots when a stock price gets too high,” said Kim Forrest, senior equity research analyst, Fort Pitt Capital Group in Pittsburgh.“Higher prices per stock makes them difficult to buy for $500,000 portfolios.” (Reporting by Rodrigo Campos.

(0930/1330) Separately, Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia President Charles Plosser speaks on monetary policy before the Council on Foreign Relations. (0800/1200). The Labor Department is expected to release jobless claims data for the week. Initial claims for state unemployment benefits likely fell last week after a surprise spike upwards a week earlier that economists suggested was due to trouble seasonally adjusting the data around the Easter and Passover holidays. The decrease to an expected 325,000 would bring them back into line with their recent trend and suggest the labor market’s recovery is on track.(0830/1230) Euro zone monetary policy is likely to remain steady when the Governing Council of the European Central Bank meets, but markets will be trying to gauge how close the bank is to action. Oil and gas company Apache Corp, which has a large presence in the Permian Basin in Texas, is scheduled to report first-quarter earnings.Argentina’s state-owned oil company YPF is expected to report results for the first quarter. The company’s figures are closely followed by markets because it is leading the investment efforts to develop the Vaca Muerta’s shale oil and gas formation.Acquisitive Canadian drug company Valeant Pharmaceuticals is scheduled to report first-quarter results. The focus will be on the company’s hostile $47 billion bid, with help from activist investor Bill Ackman, for rival Allergan. Online travel agency Priceline.com is expected to report a higher first-quarter profit as its top brand, Booking.com, grew in the United States. The company faces more competition in the online space, but it has growth opportunities because of its sizable presence in emerging markets.Satellite TV provider Dish Network is expected to report first-quarter results slightly above analysts’ estimates, according to StarMine data. Charlie Ergen, Dish’s billionaire chairman, may give his views on the M&A landscape on a conference call. Dish’s rival DirecTV has reportedly been approached by AT&T for a takeover, but analysts say Dish is actually AT&T’s preferred target.Eyes will be on Germany and the United States as Deutsche Telekom is scheduled to report first-quarter results. The company has said in March that it would spend more money attracting customers to its T-Mobile business in the United States, suggesting it aims to go it alone in that market for now even though there is talk of a sale of the company.Japan’s Toyota, the world’s biggest automaker by sales volume, is scheduled to announce full-year earnings. The company is expected to post record profits for the year ended March, buoyed by a weaker yen that made its export business more profitable and strong sales in Japan ahead of the sales tax hike in April. CBS, which will likely lose its top-rated status among the 18-49 year old viewers that advertisers want, is expected to still report strong first-quarter results. The earnings will be driven by deals it has made this year for digital showing of its TV shows with Amazon and Hulu Plus, as the company continues to build its non-advertising related revenues. Canadian auto parts maker Magna International is expected to report higher earnings per share and revenue during the first quarter, helped by continued strength in the North American market and improvements in European and developing markets. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, whose eye drug has become one of the fastest growing medicines in the history of biotechnology, is scheduled to report first-quarter results. Investors will be looking for any change in Regeneron’s 2014 sales forecast for Eylea, as the company has said it expects the drug to be approved for new uses. The company said in February that it expected Eylea sales of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion in the United States.News Corp is expected to report third-quarter results and the focus will be on its large trove of cash - it just made its largest acquisition in the book publishing division - and any update regarding a permanent CEO for one of its key divisions, Dow Jones. Anti-virus software maker Symantec is likely to report fourth-quarter results in line with analysts’ estimates. Recently, the company sacked its CEO for the second time in less than two years as it struggles to revive growth amid eroding PC sales. Symantec has been losing market share to rivals such as FireEye and Palo Alto Networks. Investors will look out for management commentary on the appointment of a new CEO and the outlook for the year.CEO Greg Maffei may shed light about the Charter-Comcast spin-off and divestitures that were announced last week when Liberty Media announces its first-quarter results. Liberty owns 27 percent of Charter and its Chairman John Malone was seen as instrumental in the recent deal with Comcast. Nuance Communications, best known for making the software that powers the Siri feature on Apple’s iPhones, is expected to report a drop in profit in the second quarter due to certain deferred deals with phone makers as the company tried to hold on to its higher pricing. However, Nuance is in the process of replacing the expired contracts, which will help boost profit from the next quarter. Nuance’s tie-up with Intel last year to supply its dictation applications for Lenovo, Asus, Acer and Toshiba notebooks is expected to boost results this quarter. Nvidia is expected to give its revenue forecast for the July quarter as investors worry about the chipmaker’s slow progress expanding into smartphones and tablets. On Tuesday, the company posted its results for the April quarter early after a preliminary draft was accidentally emailed to about 100 internal individuals. AMC Networks is likely to report a fall in first-quarter profit as it spends more on programming to replace marquee shows such as “Breaking Bad”. The cable TV network will air the final season of its long-running hit “Mad Men” from April to June. Investors are hoping that AMC’s two new shows “Turn” and “Halt & Catch Fire”, which are expected to debut in 2014, turn out to be hits as big as “Breaking Bad” and “Mad Men”. New York area-cable provider Cablevision is scheduled to report first-quarter results and investors will watch whether the signs of a turnaround it showed last quarter are sticking. Credit investment and private equity firm Apollo Global Management is scheduled to report first-quarter financial results with investors focused on the outlook for asset sales and the impact of a potential rise in interest rates. Chile’s central bank is expected to release April’s inflation rate. Investors will watch for whether a recent uptick in price pressures continues, and how that could potentially affect the bank’s rate-setting strategy. Also, Peru’s central bank is expected to announce whether it will hold the benchmark interest rate at 4 percent as it has for the past five months. Separately, data from Mexico is expected to show whether inflation continued to cool in April below the central bank’s 4 percent ceiling, from the 3.76 percent pace notched in March. Cheetah Mobile, the Chinese security and optimization software maker for mobile phones and PCs, will become the latest in a slew of Chinese companies to go public in the United States. Cheetah is being spun out of Kingsoft Corp, a unit of Hong Kong-listed entertainment and office software maker. Cheetah is looking to raise up to $174 million by offering 12 million American depositary shares at $12.30-$14.50 each. The recent selloff in Chinese tech stocks and waning appetite for companies in a crowded IPO market are likely to pressure the company’s pricing on Wednesday. Kingsoft owns more than 50 percent of Cheetah’s shares, while Tencent Holdings is the second largest shareholder with an 18 percent stake."
2014-5-08,"Regeneron eye drug sales grow, but fall short of expectations",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0NU4JA20140508,"(Adds analyst & CEO comment, stock movement)May 8 (Reuters) - U.S. sales of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s eye drug Eylea missed market estimates due to a drop in distributor inventory and a severe U.S. winter that prevented patients from visiting clinics to receive the treatment.The drug has been steadily grabbing market share from Roche AG’s Lucentis since its launch in late 2011.U.S. sales of Eylea rose 14 percent to $359 million during the first quarter ended March 31.But Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville said Eylea’s sales had “slowed to some degree” as the market had “reached a bit of a steady state.”“I think it’s an element of people having extremely high expectations, given the sort of trend the company was on, of sort of providing guidance they would then subsequently beat,” Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville said.Cowen analysts said the market consensus for U.S. Eylea sales was $404 million for the quarter.Sales of the drug outside the United States increased more than three-fold, to $218 million. Bayer AG markets the drug in countries other than the United States and Regeneron recognized $61 million from its share of net profit from Eylea’s international sales.Eylea is an injectable drug used to treat wet age-related macular edema - the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.Regeneron reiterated its 2014 U.S. sales forecast for Eylea, saying it still expects the drug’s U.S. sales to reach $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion this year.The biotechnology company posted a better-than-expected first-quarter adjusted profit, even as net income fell to $65.4 million, or 58 cents per share, in the quarter ended March 31, from $98.9 million, or 90 cents per share, a year earlier.A higher tax rate hurt earnings in the latest quarter, the company said. Excluding items, Regeneron earned $2.26 per share.Total revenue rose 42 percent to $625.7 million.Analysts on average had expected an adjusted profit of $2.20 per share, on revenue of $609.5 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Eylea is also being developed for use in diabetic macular edema (DME) and macular edema following a common retinal disease.Regeneron shares were down 1.6 percent at $282.41 in early trading on the Nasdaq.

2014-5-13,Gene Signal in talks for a partner for eye disease drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0DT16R20140513,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Gene Signal is in talks with potential partners to help develop its new treatment for a leading cause of blindness in the elderly, the biotech firm’s chief executive said on Tuesday.Privately-held Gene Signal is looking to muscle in on the lucrative market for treating wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) currently dominated by Roche’s Lucentis and Regeneron’s Eylea.Unlike Lucentis and Eylea, which must be injected into the eye, Gene Signal’s aganirsen is administered topically as an eye drop or an emulsion, making it a less cumbersome and potentially more convenient treatment.Pre-clinical studies by the Lausanne-based firm have already shown the drug can travel from the front to the back of the eye - one of the main challenges for topical medicines - giving the company confidence ahead of the start of a mid-stage trial in the third quarter.Chief Executive Eric Viaud, who co-founded Gene Signal in 2000, said the company was already in discussions about possible partnerships to develop the drug in AMD. He said he would prefer a partnership over an initial public offering.Aganirsen could be both a complementary and alternative treatment since the efficacy of injectable therapies can diminish over time, Viaud told Reuters.“We know that we have an add-on effect. It’s also an alternative when you cannot use injections any more because of local infections or side effects,” he said.But the drug faces high hurdles to challenge the dominance of Lucentis and Eylea - fast-growing drugs which racked up multi-billion dollar sales last year and have set the standard for efficacy and safety, said Helvea analyst Olav Zilian.Gene Signal is also in a race with New York-based Ohr Pharmaceutical Inc, which is conducting mid-stage trials for its own eye drop. An interim analysis of the data is expected in the second quarter of this year.Viaud was sanguine about the competition, pointing to the growing ranks of elderly which are expected to drive demand for eye drugs. AMD affects 1.8 million Americans aged 40 or above, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Recent positive results of a late-stage trial testing aganirsen as a treatment for patients who suffer from abnormal blood vessel growth in the front of the eye, have also boosted Viaud’s confidence about the drug’s efficacy.Gene Signal is working on a short, final trial in this indication and expects to file for regulatory approval within the next two years.While the company has sufficient financial firepower to market aganirsen as a treatment for this smaller indication in Europe, it would need to partner with a bigger player if it is to launch the drug in the United States or as a treatment for AMD, Viaud said."
2014-5-19,Ophthotech may get over $1 bln from eye drug deal with Novartis,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0O54AQ20140519,"(Adds details, analyst comments)May 19 (Reuters) - Ophthotech Corp said it could potentially receive over $1 billion in payments as part of a licensing deal for its experimental eye drug with Novartis AG .Ophthotech’s shares rose as much as 29 percent in trading after the bell.The company said on Monday that a unit of Novartis will market its lead experimental eye drug, Fovista, outside the United States.Ophthotech said it could receive immediate and near-term milestone payments of up to $330 million and is eligible to get ex-US marketing approval and sales milestone payments of up to $700 million.The payments do not include future royalties from sales of the drug outside the United States, the company said.“The deal validates Fovista, while importantly allowing the company to retain and fund the drug’s development and US commercialization,” J.P. Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham said in a note.Ophthotech is testing Fovista in late-stage studies to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in combination with standard treatments including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Eylea and Roche Holding AG’s Avastin and Lucentis.Ophthotech said it expects initial data from Fovista’s development program in 2016.Wet AMD is caused by abnormal blood vessels leaking blood or fluid into the retina and is the more advanced form of AMD, the most common cause of blindness in the elderly.Fovista is designed to strip cells that wrap around newly-formed blood vessels in the eye, allowing the standard treatments to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels.Ophthotech said Novartis would develop and market the technology such as a pre-filled syringe to deliver the injectable eye drug.The company also said Fovista could be used in a fixed combination with an experimental treatment of Novartis.Ophthotech said it will file for approval of the drug in the United States, and will collaborate with Novartis to seek approval outside the country.The company’s shares, priced at $22 in its IPO in September, closed at $31.46 on the Nasdaq on Monday."
2014-5-19,Pfizer-AstraZeneca deal not quite dead yet,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSBREA4I0UM20140519,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc may have called its $118 billion bid for AstraZeneca Plc a “final” offer, and its British rival sees no prospect of a deal being revived. But Wall Street isn’t ready to call in the undertakers.“The deal is wounded, but perhaps not dead,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst with ISI Group in New York.Morningstar analyst Damien Conover in Chicago said the odds of an AstraZeneca purchase had fallen well below the 50 percent mark.AstraZeneca shareholders, some of them already expressing their disappointment over the company’s rebuff of Pfizer, may still pressure the board to reconsider, analysts and fund managers said on Monday. That could force the British company to engage with Pfizer, the largest U.S. drugmaker.If they don’t, Pfizer could come back with a new price in six months’ time as prescribed by UK takeover rules.“I still have to believe this deal is far from dead,” said Raghuram Selvaraju, healthcare equity research analyst with Aegis Capital in New York, noting that substantial stakeholders on both sides want the deal to happen.“If Pfizer can tweak its bid a little bit more, then AstraZeneca shareholders are getting a very good deal, and they should take it,” Selvaraju said. “They’re really not that far apart as far as I can tell.”When Pfizer delivered its “final” cash-and-stock offer of 55 pounds per share - or around 70 billion pounds - on Sunday, it said it would walk away rather than go directly to shareholders in a hostile takeover maneuver. AstraZeneca management had indicated any offer below 58.85 pounds per share undervalued the company.“It seems like Pfizer was very adamant about wanting to do the deal. The latest salvo of discussion suggests the chances have declined, but they’re not zero,” said Les Funtleyder, author of “Healthcare Investing” and a consulting partner in U.K.-based Bluecloud Healthcare consulting firm.Pfizer spokeswoman Joan Campion said in an emailed statement: “The fate of the deal is now up to AstraZeneca’s shareholders. We believe our final proposal represents compelling and full value for AstraZeneca shareholders.”If the deal goes through, it would create the world’s largest drugmaker.One of the primary reasons driving Pfizer’s bid for AstraZeneca is the UK’s significantly lower corporate tax rate, which Pfizer could take advantage of if it were allowed to redomicile in Britain. Those kinds of savings would not be available if it chose another takeover target.Len Yaffe, portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based healthcare fund StockDoc Partners, which has Pfizer holdings, said he believes Pfizer should focus on building its pipeline of drugs in development rather than tax engineering.“Where they would get a better return in the long term, it would make sense for them to buy,” Yaffe said, citing large biotech companies such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Gilead Sciences Celgene and Biogen Idec, whose promising new drugs have lifted their stock prices.Pfizer Chief Executive Officer Ian Read has signaled the company won’t consider large U.S. drugmaker acquisitions, given the comparatively high tax rates.AstraZeneca has been promoting its own pipeline, especially its cancer immunotherapy drugs, in making the case that Pfizer has undervalued the company. CEO Pascal Soriot forecast revenue growing above $45 billion by 2023.“Pascal Soriot can say whatever he wants about projections that go out 10 years. The only thing we know about such projections is that they will be wrong,” Selvaraju said.For tax-inversion purposes, GlaxoSmithKline with a market cap of $132 billion was the only comparable target, according to Selvaraju.“GlaxoSmithKline is nowhere near as weak as AstraZeneca,” he said. “It almost has to be (AstraZeneca) or Pfizer goes back to playing the waiting game.”"
2014-5-19,Ophthotech may get over $1 billion from eye drug deal with Novartis,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0DZ1VE20140519,"(Reuters) - Ophthotech Corp said it could potentially receive over $1 billion in payments as part of a licensing deal for its experimental eye drug with Novartis AG.Ophthotech’s shares rose as much as 29 percent in trading after the bell.The company said on Monday that a unit of Novartis will market its lead experimental eye drug, Fovista, outside the United States. [ID:nBw3hlBzBa]Ophthotech said it could receive immediate and near-term milestone payments of up to $330 million and is eligible to get ex-US marketing approval and sales milestone payments of up to $700 million.The payments do not include future royalties from sales of the drug outside the United States, the company said. “The deal validates Fovista, while importantly allowing the company to retain and fund the drug’s development and US commercialization,” J.P. Morgan analyst Geoff Meacham said in a note.Ophthotech is testing Fovista in late-stage studies to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), in combination with standard treatments including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Eylea and Roche Holding AG’s Avastin and Lucentis.Ophthotech said it expects initial data from Fovista’s development program in 2016.Wet AMD is caused by abnormal blood vessels leaking blood or fluid into the retina and is the more advanced form of AMD, the most common cause of blindness in the elderly.Fovista is designed to strip cells that wrap around newly-formed blood vessels in the eye, allowing the standard treatments to inhibit the growth of new blood vessels.Ophthotech said Novartis would develop and market the technology such as a pre-filled syringe to deliver the injectable eye drug.The company also said Fovista could be used in a fixed combination with an experimental treatment of Novartis.Ophthotech said it will file for approval of the drug in the United States, and will collaborate with Novartis to seek approval outside the country.The company’s shares, priced at $22 in its IPO in September, closed at $31.46 on the Nasdaq on Monday."
2014-5-28,Valeant injects cash into bid for Botox maker Allergan,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0OE2JK20140528,"(Updates deal value)May 28 (Reuters) - Canada’s Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc raised the cash component of its unsolicited offer for Botox maker Allergan Inc on Wednesday, but the increased bid fell short of expectations and both stocks dropped.Valeant’s sweetened offer values Allergan at about $49.9 billion, based on 303.5 million shares outstanding. It also includes the possibility of additional payments worth up to $7.6 billion related to the future sales of an experimental eye drug.“I was actually surprised (Valeant) didn’t go higher,” said David Amsellem, analyst at Piper Jaffray. “Clearly they are going to continue to be aggressive, making a full-court press to get this done.”Valeant’s New York-listed shares dropped 1.7 percent in midafternoon to $127.61, while Allergan stock lost 4.5 percent to $157.67.Valeant raised its cash component to $58.30 per Allergan share, compared with its previous offer of $48.30. The stock component remains at 0.83 of a Valeant share for each Allergan share.The new offer valued Allergan at $164.22 per share as of midday Wednesday, about 7 percent higher than the previous bid of $153 as of April 22, when Valeant first made its offer.Valeant made the initial offer, worth $47 billion, together with activist investor Bill Ackman. Allergan spurned their advance, saying the Canadian company had overstated possible savings. Allergan is best known for its lucrative Botox medicine, which is injected into muscles to smooth wrinkles and used to treat various other ailments.Valeant’s offer on Wednesday was lower than the $180-$200 per share that investors were looking for, according to an investor survey last week.It includes a so-called contingent value right, or a right to receive additional benefit, worth up to $25 per share. The possible payments would reflect sales of Darpin, Allergan’s experimental eye drug, a potential competitor to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s successful Eylea, used to treat the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.“Allergan shareholders want this deal to occur, but they want a higher price and the optionality on Darpin,” Valeant Chief Executive Michael Pearson said in a meeting in New York with several hundred shareholders. “We think the offer we made this morning addresses both of those concerns.”Allergan said it would review and consider the revised proposal.Even as news of the revised offer settled in, Pearson fielded questions about the company’s next moves.Valeant expects to win approval shortly from the Securities and Exchange Commission to hold a non-binding vote of Allergan shareholders by early July, Pearson said, a move aimed at pressuring Allergan to negotiate. He also said the company was willing to take its offer directly to Allergan shareholders and force a special meeting. That would require Allergan’s board to waive the poison pill it passed to stop Ackman from raising his stake.“We are open to any and all approaches to try to get this deal consummated,” he said. “It would be a real shame if we can’t engage the board and management to get this done sooner rather than later.”The company is open to a split if it becomes too large, Pearson said, adding that Valeant’s “objective in life is not just to become large.”Pearson said in January that the company would look to become one of the world’s top five pharmaceutical companies by market capitalization by the end of 2016.Valeant’s 3-1/2-hour meeting with investors was intended to blunt Allergan’s criticisms about its organic revenue growth, management experience and its aggressive approach to acquisitions.Separately, Valeant said on Wednesday it would sell some of its skincare treatments business, including facial fillers for treating wrinkles, to Nestle SA for $1.4 billion in cash. The move would make it easier for an acquisition of Allergan to win anti-trust approvals, analysts said.

2014-5-28,"Insurers scrutinize drug costs after $84,000 Sovaldi surprise",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0E80AZ20140528,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Shocked by the rapid adoption of a new $84,000 hepatitis C treatment, U.S. health insurers are trying to make sure they aren’t blindsided by other drugs being developed and are looking for ways to limit their use from the day they are launched.Manufacturer Gilead Sciences Inc says 30,000 people have received hepatitis drug Sovaldi so far, and that sales hit a record-breaking $2.3 billion within a few months. The treatment, typically 84 pills taken over 12 weeks, completely cures the disease in more than 90 percent of patients.As many as 3.2 million Americans are infected by hepatitis C, and the cost of giving most of them Sovaldi would surpass $200 billion. Some insurers have already put conditions on who can get the drug, and states including California and Texas have slowed or put treatment on hold while they study what to do.Insurers warned that these unforeseen costs will cut 2014 earnings and require rate hikes. Now, at industry conferences, in conversations with investors, and in private, they are pushing Gilead’s rivals, a group that includes AbbVie Inc, Merck & Co and Bristol-Myers Squibb Co, to discount their own new hepatitis C treatments when they come to market starting this fall. Such a high-profile campaign by insurers before drugs are even approved is new.They are also signaling they will restrict who can get coverage for new cholesterol drugs being developed by Amgen Inc, Pfizer Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA.By law, insurers cannot deny access to new drugs if they represent a real improvement for patients, leaving drug companies with the upper hand in most price discussions. When comparable competitors, or a generic version is on the market about a decade later, insurers have room to steer patients away from the new drugs, and pharmaceutical companies cut prices steeply and give big discounts.But insurers have not faced such a highly effective drug aimed at a widespread disease that is so expensive and so quickly adopted. The previous record for a drug reaching blockbuster status was set in 2011, when hepatitis C therapy Incivek from Vertex Pharmaceuticals raked in $1.56 billion for the entire year. Sovaldi has sold more in a quarter of the time.As a result, insurers are taking a harder line on which patients should get Sovaldi, based on the drug’s clinical data.Sovaldi is “game-changing” for insurers’ thinking, said John Whang, co-president of Reimbursement Intelligence, a consulting firm that helps pharmaceutical companies set prices. The only way for them to respond is to control the volume of treatment used, he said.In a sign of how serious the industry has become, the largest insurer lobby group last week took Gilead to task at a public conference.“The company in this case is asking for a blank check and you can’t give anyone anymore a blank check because it will blow up family budgets, state Medicaid budgets, employer costs and wreak havoc on the federal debt,” said Karen Ignagni, president of America’s Health Insurance Plans.Gilead argues that Sovaldi’s price is worth it, since it will replace even costlier spending on hospital visits and treatments for cirrhosis or liver failure. It has not budged on price for the hepatitis C drug, although Gregg Alton, Gilead’s executive vice president for corporate and medical affairs, acknowledged that insurers are going to start negotiating.U.S. drug spending reached a record $329 billion in 2013, driven by a double-digit increase in prices for new cancer, HIV and hepatitis C therapies. Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, expects spending on such specialty drugs to rise an additional 63 percent from 2014 to 2016, driven by an 1,800 percent increase in hepatitis C drug costs.Successful drugs can cost $1 billion to bring to market, including spending on research, development and marketing. Supporters of drug companies say big advances necessitate high prices.“We are the only country in the world that pays exorbitant prices to provide innovation first here, but that’s what we need and that’s what the American people have come to expect,” said Richard Burr, a Republican Senator from North Carolina who has spent decades working on bipartisan health bills.Hepatitis C complications can take years to develop, which gives insurers and government health agencies leeway to determine when treatment should start.Many insurers, which manage most of the 150 million people covered by employer-based plans as well as some government Medicare and Medicaid plans, require patients to get authorization before using Sovaldi. Some limit the drug to patients with a certain genetic type of the disease.Express Scripts has been pushing for all but the sickest patients to wait for new therapies that are expected to compete head-to-head with Sovaldi late this year. It is also pressing rival manufacturers for low prices, hoping to avoid the shock of Sovaldi, which sped through trials and regulatory approval and caught insurers by surprise.“In this particular case there was very little discussion pre-launch. But other companies are now already discussing potential future price points in response,” said Steve Miller, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer.AbbVie and Merck both declined to comment on whether discussions with insurers about their new drugs were underway.Gilead, which says it discussed the Sovaldi launch with insurers, is in talks over which patients should be treated with its next hepatitis C pill. That will be a two-drug combination that will eliminate the need for a companion drug that nearly doubles Sovaldi’s current total cost.Industry analysts expect the company will price it closer to Sovaldi’s $84,000 than to the $150,000 cost of a combination of Sovaldi and a Johnson & Johnson drug that some doctors prescribe.Mick Kolassa, chairman of pricing consultancy Medical Marketing Economics, in Oxford, Mississippi, who advises pharma companies, says insurers are being aggressive. “We are seeing some of them step up and flex their muscles,” he said.More scrutiny of new pricing is likely ahead as the country comes to terms with how it should pay for expensive drugs, according to John Castellani, Chief Executive Officer of leading drug industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA.Sovaldi has shown that patients are bearing too much of the drug’s costs because of rising co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, he told Reuters, laying the blame on factors controlled by insurance companies.But patient advocates are not choosing sides yet, which may have the effect of giving insurers room for action.“I think the fault lies with both the for-profit insurers and the drug companies,” said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at the San Francisco-based Project Inform, which advocates for hepatitis C patients. The system has not changed to reflect the impact of new effective, expensive drugs, she said.The next big price battle centers on a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which help the liver to clear “bad” LDL cholesterol from the blood.Large-scale studies show the new drugs can help patients who cannot tolerate, or get enough benefit from, the most widely-used cholesterol drugs, statins. The PCSK9 therapies are expected to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the price of statins sold as generics.Drugmakers are expected to push for the new medicines to be used by 7 million to 20 million people, or up to 30 percent of the 71 million Americans with high cholesterol. Insurers already are questioning whether the estimates of use are legitimate.“There is really no need to take these new medications and spread them out across a larger community of people who will respond to existing treatments, many of which are generic,” Aetna Inc’s National Medical Director for Pharmacy Policy Ed Pezalla said in an interview.(The story corrects to Reimbursement Intelligence from Intelligence Reimbursement, to Whang as co-president from president, to Steve Miller from Stuart Miller)"

2014-5-28,TIMELINE-RPT-Early signs of pushback over U.S. drug prices,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0OE01Y20140528,"(Repeats timeline with no changes)May 28 (Reuters) - Gilead Sciences’ $84,000 treatment for hepatitis C, Sovaldi, has broken the sales record for drug launches and caused a backlash among insurers concerned by the cost. Before the Sovaldi outcry, U.S. insurers and doctors made limited attempts to curb the rising cost of novel medicines.Here is a timeline of drug pricing clashes:Late 2012 - France’s Sanofi and U.S.-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals drop the price on cancer drug Zaltrap after a prominent hospital, New York’s Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, refuses to use it, saying it worked no better than a similar, cheaper drug.December 6, 2013 - Gilead receives approval from the U.S. Food & Drug Administration for new hepatitis C medication Sovaldi and announces it will charge $84,000 for the typical course of treatment.January 2014 - Express Scripts, which manages drug benefits programs, for the first time drops 48 brand-name drugs and pieces of equipment from its recommended list of approved drugs because there were more affordable, clinically equivalent alternatives available. It is the most comprehensive decision to drop drugs from a large formulary to date.March 4, 2014 - Molina Healthcare, a small California Medicaid insurer, starts a public campaign about the price of Sovaldi, saying it cannot afford to pay for the treatment and asking California and other states to set aside money to do so.March 21, 2014 - U.S. Representative Henry Waxman calls for an investigation of Sovaldi pricing. Waxman, a Democrat who helped build a government buying program for HIV drugs more than two decades ago, asks Gilead to justify prices that will fall to the taxpayers who support government insurance programs including Medicaid, Medicare, the Veterans Affairs Bureau and the federal and state prison systems. Shares in Gilead and other top names in biotechnology fall on fears the industry as a whole will face resistance to ever-higher drug prices.March 31, 2014 - Global sales of Sovaldi reach $2.3 billion in the first three months on the market, a record launch for any drug. At least 30,000 patients have used the medicine. Wall Street expects sales for 2014 to top $8 billion.April 2, 2014 - California’s Kaiser Permanente hospital-insurer system calls Sovaldi’s price “outrageous” and says Gilead has not cut it a big enough discount.April 9, 2014 - The World Health Organization calls for a “concerted effort” to drive down the cost of new hepatitis C drugs that offer a cure but are unaffordable for most infected people worldwide.April 11, 2014 - Texas delays a decision on imposing strict limits on Sovaldi in its Medicaid health plan for the poor, at the urging of outside advisers. The move delays access to the drug in the state Medicaid program until at least August.April 17, 2014 - UnitedHealth Group Inc, the largest U.S. health insurer, makes an unusual move by detailing the unexpected costs of a single drug, Sovaldi, during the first quarter.April 18, 2014 - Biogen prices hemophilia drug Alprolix in the same range as existing, but less convenient products, in order to gain market share.May 21, 2014 - The nation’s largest insurer group calls on payers and drugmakers to solve the drug pricing problem posed by Sovaldi before the U.S. government gets involved. The pharmacy industry says the insurance system needs to be reformed. (Reporting by Caroline Humer, editing by Michele Gershberg and Peter Henderson)"

That will be a two-drug combination that will eliminate the need for a companion drug that nearly doubles Sovaldi’s current total cost.Industry analysts expect the company will price it closer to Sovaldi’s $84,000 than to the $150,000 cost of a combination of Sovaldi and a Johnson & Johnson drug that some doctors prescribe.Mick Kolassa, chairman of pricing consultancy Medical Marketing Economics, in Oxford, Mississippi, who advises pharma companies, says insurers are being aggressive. “We are seeing some of them step up and flex their muscles,” he said.More scrutiny of new pricing is likely ahead as the country comes to terms with how it should pay for expensive drugs, according to John Castellani, Chief Executive Officer of leading drug industry lobby group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America or PhRMA.Sovaldi has shown that patients are bearing too much of the drug’s costs because of rising co-payments, co-insurance and deductibles, he told Reuters, laying the blame on factors controlled by insurance companies.But patient advocates are not choosing sides yet, which may have the effect of giving insurers room for action.“I think the fault lies with both the for-profit insurers and the drug companies,” said Anne Donnelly, director of healthcare policy at the San Francisco-based Project Inform, which advocates for hepatitis C patients. The system has not changed to reflect the impact of new effective, expensive drugs, she said.The next big price battle centers on a new class of cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors, which help the liver to clear “bad” LDL cholesterol from the blood.Large-scale studies show the new drugs can help patients who cannot tolerate, or get enough benefit from, the most widely-used cholesterol drugs, statins. The PCSK9 therapies are expected to cost thousands of dollars a year, far above the price of statins sold as generics.Drugmakers are expected to push for the new medicines to be used by 7 million to 20 million people, or up to 30 percent of the 71 million Americans with high cholesterol. Insurers already are questioning whether the estimates of use are legitimate.“There is really no need to take these new medications and spread them out across a larger community of people who will respond to existing treatments, many of which are generic,” Aetna Inc’s National Medical Director for Pharmacy Policy Ed Pezalla said in an interview.

2014-6-24,Ohr Pharma eye drug falls short in trial,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0EZ15Y20140624,"(Reuters) - Ohr Pharmaceutical Inc said its experimental eye drop showed no significant benefit over a placebo in reducing the number of injections of another drug directly into the eye, but improved patients’ visual clarity.The company’s shares were down 3.5 percent at $11 in heavy premarket trading after gaining as much as 14 percent.The drug, Squalamine, is Ohr’s lead product and was being tested in a mid-stage trial in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness among the elderly.An interim analysis of trial data showed patients getting Squalamine needed an average of 6.2 eye injections, while those on placebo needed 6.4.The main goal was to reduce the number of required injections of Roche Holding AG’s Lucentis, which is approved for treating AMD.However, the study showed that Squalamine improved patients’ visual clarity compared to the placebo. Patients getting the drug experienced an average change of about 10.4 letters, compared to 6.3 for those on placebo.“We believe that showing visual acuity improvements is far more meaningful to a wet AMD patient than reducing the number of injections, especially when the frequency of injections is already low,” Brean Capital analyst Jonathan Aschoff wrote in a note.Aschoff, who has a “buy” rating on the stock, raised his price target on Ohr to $34 from $21.AMD has proved to be a lucrative market for Roche and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. Regeneron’s Eylea, another eye injection, is considered to be one of the fastest growing biotechnology drugs with about $838 million in sales in its first full year on the market."

Allergan now expects the agency’s next action in the second quarter of 2015.Allergan shares were down 2.4 percent at $169.81.In its letter, the FDA expressed concern about the delivery device for the aerosol migraine medication, citing “content uniformity on the improved canister filling process and on standards for device actuation,” Allergan said.“We believe we may have existing data to answer FDA’s questions,” Allergan research and development chief Scott Whitcup told analysts on a conference call on its pipeline of drugs in development.“There is no scenario I can imagine under which we would not take this forward,” Whitcup said.JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott called the Semprana delay a modest negative, but added in a research note: “We expect the company to respond to the FDA by year end and now believe we could see an approval by the second quarter of 2015.”Allergan also announced plans to begin large Phase III trials of its closely watched Darpin treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration in the second quarter of 2015.The company has cited the future sales potential of Darpin and Valeant’s lack of commitment to research and development as one of its arguments for remaining independent.“Valeant has neither the expertise nor the commitment to maximize the value of Darpin,” Allergan said in its pipeline presentation on Monday.Data from a small Phase II trial appears to suggest that Darpin is at least as effective as Roche’s Lucentis, with a longer duration of activity.Allergan said it believed Darpin could dry the retina more quickly and effectively than current treatments, possibly leading to superior vision improvement. The drug would also compete with Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc’s Eylea.Allergan said an improved manufacturing process could reduce incidence of ocular inflammation seen in earlier Darpin trials.But JPMorgan’s Schott said: “Today’s update does not change our view that a potential combination with Valeant represents the path to greatest value creation for both companies.”Ozurdex, Allergan’s sustained-release biodegradable steroid implant, received additional U.S. approval to treat diabetic macular edema (DME) in adult patients who have an artificial lens implant or are scheduled for cataract surgery.Allergan said it hoped to receive European DME approval in the second half of this year.The drug was previously approved to treat macular edema and non-infectious ocular inflammation.

2014-7-01,Sanofi raises stake in Regeneron; shares jump,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0PC18920140701,"(Adds analyst comment, share purchase detail, updates trading)July 1 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc shares jumped nearly 7 percent Tuesday after Sanofi SA said it would raise its stake in the U.S. biotechnology company, and as a competitive threat to Regeneron’s top drug appeared to diminish.French drugmaker Sanofi, in a U.S. regulatory filing, said it would boost its Regeneron holdings to up to 22.5 percent by July 29, under an agreement between the companies allowing Sanofi to own up to 30 percent of Regeneron.As part of that effort, Sanofi bought 50,000 Regeneron shares Friday at various prices between $272.69 and $277.43 per share, the filing said.Sanofi had a 20.5 percent stake in Regeneron as of April 7.The Sanofi vote of confidence in Regeneron helped push Regeneron shares back above $300 after a nearly 10 percent decline over the past month.“As the stake keeps going up it gives the perception to the Street or investors that Sanofi will eventually acquire Regeneron,” said Roth Capital Partners analyst Joseph Pantginis.There is currently a no-acquisition clause in the long-term agreements between the two companies.“The standstill clause does protect them, but deals can always be renegotiated,” Pantginis said. “They already renegotiated maximum cap that Sanofi can own.”In January, Regeneron said its investor agreement with Sanofi allows the French drugmaker to take a 30 percent stake and to name a board member. It appointed Robert Ingram to Regeneron’s board earlier this year.The two companies have several drug development partnerships, including on the big-selling eye drug Eylea and a potential multi-billion dollar cholesterol drug which is completing late-stage development.Sanofi and Regeneron investors were also cheered by news from Allergan Inc on Monday. Allergan provided an update on Darpin, its potential rival to Eylea, that eased concerns over any near-term competition. Allergan said it would not begin pivotal Phase III trials of the drug before the second quarter of 2015.Regeneron reported first-quarter U.S. Eylea sales of $359 million.Darpin is “definitely a competitive threat for Eylea, but the time line seems to be quite a while for them to get it on the market,” said Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville.Analysts said the Phase II data Allergan released and its Phase III plans alleviated some concerns, and that the Regeneron stock had been oversold.“The comparator they’re using in Phase 3 is (Roche’s Lucentis, not Eylea,” Quenneville noted. “For some people it’s indicative that they don’t have a lot of confidence that they would be able to show significant differentiation against Eylea.”Regeneron shares were up $18.93, or 6.7 percent, at $301.40 in afternoon trading on Nasdaq.

2014-7-08,French lawmakers back Roche cancer drug as cheap eye treatment,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL6N0PJ1XA20140708,"* Move could spark trend in budget-minded EU countries* Experts say Avastin works well but poses some risks* EU shift to Avastin a threat to Novartis, Bayer profitsPARIS, July 8 (Reuters) - French lawmakers voted on Tuesday to allow the use of Roche’s cancer drug Avastin as a cheap alternative eye treatment, in a budget-minded move critics fear could put patients’ health - and company profits - at risk.The French government amended its social security budget bill to allow doctors to use Avastin as a treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD)- a leading cause of blindness among the elderly. Lawmakers in France’s lower house endorsed the new budget with 272 votes for and 234 against.The decision opens a new front in a long-running battle over the unapproved use of Avastin in eye care and underscores how cash-strapped governments are finding creative ways to contain ballooning healthcare costs.Drugmakers and some medical experts worry that allowing such off-label uses of a drug without adequate clinical trials could raise health risks, including infections.Roche’s Avastin is not approved by health regulators as a treatment for AMD, but works in a similar way to the treatments currently authorised for AMD - Lucentis, marketed by Novartis and Roche, and Eylea, from Germany’s Bayer and Regeneron.France argues that encouraging the use of Avastin, which costs around 30 times less than those rival treatments, could bring annual savings of some 200 million euros ($273 million) - and the French move may prompt others in Europe to follow suit.“The economic arguments are obvious,” analysts at Berenberg wrote in a recent note. “If financial arguments prevail, this could put a big dent in these franchises for Novartis - and to a lesser extent Roche, which receives royalties - and Bayer, with implications for originator Regeneron, which receives royalties on European sales.”The analysts argue that there is a risk that France’s move could spark a “Europe-wide contagion” that could, in a worst-case scenario, reduce both Novartis and Bayer’s profits by around 3 to 4 percent.Lucentis, for which a single injection can cost as much as 900 euros, was a leading reimbursement charge in France’s healthcare budget last year, costing the social security around 430 million euros.Some doctors in the United States and Europe already prescribe the cheaper Avastin instead.A closely watched U.S. government-sponsored study in 2011 concluded that Avastin worked as well as Lucentis in treating vision loss from wet AMD but had more adverse side effects.Last week, Novartis strongly criticised France’s plans which it said put patients at risk since Avastin is not safely formulated to be injected in the eye. Roche said that financial considerations by national healthcare bodies should not compromise patient safety and EU law.In 2012, Novartis challenged the use of Avastin as a treatment for AMD in some British hospitals, saying doing so put cost savings ahead of patient needs.Novartis and Roche have always discouraged substituting Avastin for Lucentis, saying the two drugs were developed for different therapeutic purposes. Both companies have in recent months faced regulatory scrutiny in France and Italy on suspicion of anti-competitive practices.Italy said in May it was seeking 1.2 billion euros in damages from both companies, alleging they had colluded to try to stop Avastin from being used as an AMD treatment. The two companies have denied malpractice and said they would appeal the ruling.Lucentis is marketed by Novartis outside the United States and is the company’s third-biggest seller with sales of $2.4 billion last year. Sales of Lucentis for Roche, which markets the treatment in the United States, were $1.9 billion. ($1 = 0.7331 Euros) (Editing by Ben Hirschler)"

Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.Currently, patients get limited relief from topical steroid creams and oral steroid medicines that are not approved in the United States for the condition.Dupilumab works through a new approach, by blocking two proteins linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).The 16-week Phase IIb clinical trial involved 380 adults with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, and about half their skin was affected by the disease. All doses of dupilumab met the study’s main goal, showing greater improvement of eczema symptoms compared to placebo.Improvement rates ranged from 74 percent for patients on the highest dose (300 mg weekly) to 45 percent in those with the weakest dose (100 mg monthly), as judged by a standard index that evaluates area and severity of eczema. That compared with an 18 percent improvement in patients given a placebo.“It’s really the itch associated with atopic dermatitis that can affect your quality of life, your employment and ability to function and to go to school and to sleep,” George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s research chief, said in an interview.Dupilumab, if approved, would likely be the first drug to directly target proteins that cause the disease, Yancopoulos said.In separate Phase IIa trial results published last year, dupilumab slashed asthma episodes by 87 percent, making it a potential game changer for patients with moderate to severe disease.The most common side effects of the drug include nasopharyngitis (common cold) and headache.Sanofi and Regeneron expect to begin late-stage trials of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis later this year.The New England Journal of Medicine on Wednesday published favorable data from earlier studies of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis.Dr. Lisa Beck, a professor of dermatology at Rochester Medical Center who helped conduct those trials, said about 3.4 million U.S. adults have moderate to severe atopic dermatitis.“We will get a surge of eczema patients seeking treatment with this drug” if it is approved, she predicted."

If approved, these drugs could reap annual sales of $3 billion or more, according to some industry analysts.The Phase III ODYSSEY trials showed that after 24 weeks, the mean percentage reduction in LDL cholesterol with alirocumab was consistent with results seen in previous trials, the companies said in a statement.The trials involved patients whose high LDL cholesterol levels are not sufficiently controlled by existing treatments such as statins, who cannot tolerate these or who present a high or very high cardiovascular risk.“The robust data from these studies in more than 5,000 patients is the basis of our global regulatory submissions, which we expect in the U.S. and EU by year-end,” said Sanofi R&D chief Elias Zerhouni.PCSK9 inhibitors block a protein that prevents the body from eliminating LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream and offer a new way of fighting the build-up of artery-clogging fat that puts patients at risk of heart attacks.These drugs are mainly aimed at the millions of people who either cannot tolerate statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor or AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor or who cannot get their cholesterol levels under control with statins alone.In earlier mid-stage studies, when combined with statins, alirocumab and Amgen’s own PCSK9 drug cut levels of LDL cholesterol by close to 70 percent, more than statins alone.The drug was “generally well tolerated” in the trials, with most common adverse events being nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infections and injection site reactions.Serious adverse events and deaths were “generally balanced” between treatment groups as were musculoskeletal, neurocognitive and liver-related events, the companies added.An interim safety analysis showed that after 18 months of treatment, patients on alirocumab were less prone to cardiovascular events (cardiac death, myocardial infarction, stroke, and unstable angina requiring hospitalization) compared with those on placebo.Alirocumab’s potential to cut cardiovascular risk is being assessed in an ongoing 18,000-patient long-term outcomes trial.

2014-7-30,"Sanofi, Regeneron cholesterol drug may cut heart risk, trial hints",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0FZ17Q20140730,"NEW YORK/PARIS (Reuters) - A new drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc significantly cut cholesterol in nine late-stage clinical trials, the companies said on Wednesday, and provided the first glimpse of its potential to prevent heart attacks and strokes.The injectable drug, alirocumab, is from a new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors, which are also being developed by Amgen Inc and Pfizer Inc. If approved, they could lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in a new way and reap multibillion-dollar sales.An interim safety analysis of one of the Phase III studies showed patients on alirocumab were less prone, versus those on placebo, to a combination of cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, heart attack, stroke, and chest pain requiring hospitalization.That ongoing 2,341-patient study, called Odyssey Long Term, is expected to conclude early next year. Data were examined when all patients had been in the trial for a year, and about 25 percent had reached 18 months of treatment.No other drugmaker has released data suggesting reduced cardiovascular risk from PCSK9 inhibitors.But Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer, in an interview, played down the favorable cardiovascular data. He said the trial was not designed to show reduced cardiovascular risk, but to assess safety and effectiveness in lowering LDL.“One should not draw any conclusions from this,” Schleifer said, adding that the definitive word on alirocumab’s potential to cut heart risk will come from an ongoing 18,000-patient study called Odyssey Outcomes. Schleifer said, however, the favorable cardiovascular data offers encouragement that Sanofi and Regeneron are testing “the right hypothesis”.PCSK9 inhibitors cut cholesterol by blocking a protein that prevents the body from eliminating LDL from the bloodstream.In earlier mid-stage studies, alirocumab and Amgen’s own anti-PCSK9 drug, when combined with statins, cut LDL by almost 70 percent beyond reductions seen with statins alone. Data from the nine large Odyssey trials showed that after 24 weeks, LDL reductions with alirocumab were consistent with results seen in previous trials.The trials involve patients whose high LDL cholesterol levels are not sufficiently controlled by statins and other existing treatments, and patients who cannot tolerate statins or who have a high cardiovascular risk.In eight of the studies, all patients received alirocumab in addition to standard treatments such as statins and Merck & Co’s Zetia.Sanofi and Regeneron plan to seek approvals for alirocumab by year-end. The companies said they would seek a priority review from U.S. regulators that would allow for an approval decision in six months rather than the usual 10 months.The most common side effects of alirocumab in the trials included stuffy nose and upper respiratory tract infections.Regeneron is best known for its hot-selling Eylea treatment for macular degeneration. Late on Tuesday, it said U.S. regulators had approved Eylea to treat diabetic macular edema.Regeneron shares closed up 5.8 percent at $322.18 on Nasdaq, while Sanofi shares were little changed."

The social networking company also gave a revenue forecast above forecasts.“It all looks good today. Earnings have been decent and the GDP number surprised everybody for sure. In this rate environment, the market isn’t expensive and we’re still finding good values,” said Gary Bradshaw, portfolio manager at Hodges Capital Management in Dallas.Market participants shrugged off the ADP National Employment Report, which showed companies hired 218,000 workers in July, a level that was below analysts’ projections and was also down from June.The results bolstered support for Internet and other social media stocks, assuaging concerns the group is overpriced.

Analysts polled by Reuters had expected EPS of 1.14 euros a share on sales of 8.1 billion.Adverse foreign exchange rates, mainly the result of a strong euro and weak US dollar, shaved 5.5 percentage points off quarterly sales growth.At constant exchange rates, sales in emerging markets - which account for over a third of Sanofi’s revenue - rose 16.5 percent, driven by Latin America and China, and 9.4 percent in the United States. They fell 2.8 percent in Western Europe.After a string of disappointing results last year, Sanofi had provided a 2014 earnings guidance that analysts widely viewed as conservative, for business EPS to grow 4-7 percent at constant exchange rates. On Thursday, it said it now expected a rise of 6-8 percent, barring major unforeseen adverse events.“Based on the solid momentum in our late stage pipeline, we are actively preparing for a wave of new product launches that will further redefine Sanofi as a biopharmaceutical leader,” Chief Executive Chris Viehbacher said in a statement.Under pricing pressure from cash-strapped governments and tough competition from generics, Sanofi has sought like other drugmakers to revamp its research and development (R&D) to launch new, harder-to-copy and more pricey biologic drugs.It invested 1.4 billion euros so far so far this year to raise to 22 percent its stake in U.S. biotech Regeneron , its partner on several promising experimental drugs against high cholesterol, rheumatoid arthritis and asthma.Sanofi has also sought to shake off the impact of patent losses on key drugs such as blood-thinner Plavix by betting on so-called “growth platforms” that include diabetes, rare diseases and over-the-counter treatments.Sales of Lantus, the world’s most prescribed insulin, rose 16.3 percent over the quarter, to 1.56 billion euros. Sales jumped 29.1 percent at Sanofi’s rare diseases unit Genzyme and returned to growth at its animal health unit Merial, helped by the launch of new flea and tick control drug NexGard.

2014-8-01,"Massive, unusual options volume Friday confounds Wall St",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N0Q726W20140801,"(Adds details from NYSE, quotes)Aug 1 (Reuters) - A barrage of bearish options contracts costing an estimated $8 million and set to expire worthless in a few hours were purchased across multiple stocks Friday afternoon in a move that traders said made no sense.Shortly after 1 p.m. EDT (1700 GMT), more than 700,000 put options contracts were traded across a number of different stocks in 1,300 trade orders. Names traded included Priceline , Chipotle Mexican Grill and others, and the bulk of the contracts expired at the end of Friday’s trading, according to Henry Schwartz, president of Trade Alert LLC.The identities of the buyer or seller of these contracts were not immediately clear. However, representatives at several options exchanges said that trading appeared to be normal, which suggests that the trades could stand.“It looks like a fat finger, which you wouldn’t expect to be an easy thing to happen, but with today’s automation, who knows?” said Andrew Wallin, vice president of sales and trading at Lightspeed Trading in Chicago.“It all went off right in a minute. It was so fast, all happening in a few seconds, 1,300 orders, all in a minute for options expiring in three hours, all on the put side,” he said.A spokesman for the New York Stock Exchange, which runs two options exchanges, said that the firm does not have any erroneous trades on either its NYSE Arca or NYSE Amex exchanges, and therefore do not have any trades to adjust or cancel.Representatives for the Chicago Board Options Exchange, which accounts for more than 20 percent of the usual options volume, and Nasdaq OMX, which runs three options exchanges, said trading appeared normal and that no glitches were seen.The activity involves thousands of bearish put contracts in companies including Regeneron Pharmaceutical and Expedia Inc. Regeneron and Chipotle, for instance, have seen about 27 times the usual daily options volume as a result of the trades.Schwartz, in a note, said it is unclear if any trades will “qualify as obvious errors that may be bustable.”Investors buy put options in bets that a stock’s price will go down, but these bets would require a sharp drop in a matter of hours on a relatively quiet day in the stock market to become profitable. The peculiar nature of the trades led many to believe that it was caused by a mistake in recognizing when a particular contract was set to expire.Evan McDaniel, manager at IV Trading Group in Chicago, said the error was likely the result of execution. He said the buyer may have bought the wrong options contracts due to the oddity of an expiration occurring on the first of the month.In Chipotle Mexican Grill, for instance, 21 different contracts at strike prices between $582.50 and $632.50 saw more than 11,000 contracts trade. With open interest scant in most of those strikes, that means these are new positions, and would mean Chipotle’s shares would have to collapse by anywhere from 6 percent to about 15 percent in a couple of hours. The stock ended up 0.4 percent to $675.14 a share.“It appears someone may have made a mistake pressing a button because there’s no logical sense for these types of trades,” said J.J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade. “No one can really figure out why they happened; the trades make zero sense.” (Reporting by David Gaffen, Angela Moon and Ryan Vlastelica; Additional reporting by Jennifer Ablan; Editing by James Dalgleish)"

2014-8-05,Regeneron sales top forecast as Eylea picks up steam,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0G511S20140805,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O on Tuesday reported higher-than-expected quarterly results on surging demand for its Eylea treatment for macular degeneration, and stuck to its full-year sales forecast for the drug.Revenue, including research collaboration payments from French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA, jumped 45 percent to $666 million in the second quarter, topping the average forecast of $648 million among analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Eylea’s U.S. sales rose 26 percent to $415 million, above Wall Street expectations of $410 million.But Regeneron, which often raises its U.S. Eylea sales forecasts, stuck to its view of $1.7 billion to $1.8 billion for the full year.“It was a solid quarter for Eylea, but you can’t raise sales guidance every quarter,” said Morningstar analyst Stefan Quenneville. Some investors may have been disappointed that Regeneron had not nudged its 2014 view higher, Quenneville said.Although shares fell in premarket trading, they recovered and were up almost 3 percent by mid-morning. Eylea gained momentum from disappointing 14 percent U.S. sales growth in the prior quarter that was due largely to a drop in distributor inventory, said Robert Baird analyst Christopher Raymond.“We wondered if weakness in ophthalmology office visits could have spilled over into (Regeneron’s) second quarter results, but no signs of that,” Raymond said.Bayer AG BAYGn.DE, which sells Eylea outside the United States, reported a more than doubling of sales in those markets to $247 million. Regeneron recognized $67 million from its share of those sales.Regeneron earned $93 million, or 82 cents per share, including expenses for taxes and compensation. It earned $87 million, or 79 cents per share, a year earlier.Excluding special items, Regeneron earned $2.47 per share. Analysts on average expected $2.29.Macular degeneration is a leading cause of blindness among the elderly. Eylea also treats macular edema, a buildup of fluid in the back of the eye. It was approved last week for a related sight-robbing condition called diabetic macular edema.Regeneron is developing other promising medicines with Sanofi, including alirocumab, which lowers cholesterol by blocking the protein PCSK9. Although Regeneron was the first company to begin development of a PCSK9 inhibitor, Amgen Inc AMGN.N has jumped ahead with trials of its drug, AMG 145.Regeneron and Sanofi last week said alirocumab slashed cholesterol in nine late-stage studies. An interim safety analysis of one trial suggested it lowers heart attack risk.One day later, the drugmakers said they had paid $67.5 million for a voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc BMRN.O that could assure alirocumab an expedited six-month U.S. regulatory review, rather than the standard 10 months.A speedier review could help alirocumab catch up with AMG 145, analysts said. The partners bought the transferable voucher from BioMarin, which acquired it under a U.S. program that encourages development of drugs for rare pediatric diseases."

Gilead Sciences and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals were the S&P 500’s top two biggest percentage gainers, both up about 2.5 percent.Biotech stocks have been a primary leader of recent gains, and many analysts had expected the group to drive the S&P over 2,000.“The trend continues to be positive and it’s like fighting a tsunami, it keeps going and going and going and it won’t stop,” said Adam Hewison, president and chief executive at INO.com in Annapolis, Maryland.The level has more psychological than fundamental significance, and it comes amid a variety of cautious signals for the economy, including tepid U.S. growth, waning stimulus from the Federal Reserve and simmering conflict between Ukraine and Russia. In the latest economic data, reads on both the U.S. services sector and the housing market came in below forecasts.“All the world events are negative; people are just shrugging them off,” said Hewison. “I think we’re going to continue seeing gains.”The Dow Jones industrial average rose 93.37 points or 0.55 percent, to 17,094.59, the S&P 500 gained 10.6 points or 0.53 percent, to 1,999 and the Nasdaq Composite added 27.09 points or 0.6 percent, to 4,565.64.Early gains tracked European equities, where an index of major shares rose 0.9 percent after European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said Friday the ECB was prepared to respond with available tools if inflation dropped further. Investors took this to mean the ECB could start an asset purchase program or adopt other stimulus measures in the coming months, which could boost assets like stocks.Financials were a primary beneficiary of these expectations. Morgan Stanley, which has heavy exposure to Europe, rose 2.5 percent to $34.29. Goldman Sachs Group Inc, a Dow component, was up almost 2 percent at $178.90.U.S. stocks have been strong of late.

On a total-return basis the S&P 500 has more than tripled from its 2009 low hit during the financial crisis.The day’s gains were broad, with all 10 of the S&P 500’s primary sectors advancing. About two-thirds of stocks on both the New York Stock Exchange and the Nasdaq were in positive territory.“The trend continues to be positive and it’s like fighting a tsunami, it keeps going and going and going and it won’t stop,” said Adam Hewison, president and chief executive at INO.com in Annapolis, Maryland.The advance comes amid a variety of cautious signals for the economy, including tepid U.S. growth, waning stimulus from the Federal Reserve and a simmering conflict between Ukraine and Russia. In the latest economic data, reads on both the U.S. services sector and the housing market came in below forecasts.“All the world events are negative; people are just shrugging them off,” said Hewison. “I think we’re going to continue seeing gains.”Biotech stocks, a primary driver of recent equity gains, continued to outperform on Monday, with the Nasdaq Biotech index up 2.4 percent.

Including Tuesday’s move, both the Dow and the S&P have risen in 10 of the past 13 sessions, while the Nasdaq is up for 11 of the past 13 sessions. Much of the market’s recent gains have come on low volume, suggesting many traders may be reluctant to jump in at current levels.“People aren’t going to do anything too aggressive until there’s some kind of catalyst, either positive or negative, and we may end up consolidating around 2,000 for a while,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut. “We’re still in an uptrend, but it will be tough to move significantly higher from here.”U.S. consumer confidence rose more than expected in August, climbing to its highest since October 2007.

Excluding transportation, orders fell 0.8 percent.The market’s momentum is still considered intact, and the S&P’s price-to-earnings ratio is within historical norms, leading many analysts to believe stocks are not overvalued.

2014-8-28,Amgen seeks U.S. approval of new cholesterol-fighting drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0GS1NS20140828,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Thursday it applied to U.S. health regulators to sell its cholesterol fighter, evolocumab, becoming the first company to seek approval of a medicine from a closely watched new class of potent heart drugs.Amgen is racing with Regeneron Inc to bring to market the potentially lucrative new drugs aimed at patients unable to tolerate widely used statins, and those who cannot sufficiently lower cholesterol despite use of statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, or other medicines.The injectable drugs work by blocking a naturally occurring protein called PCSK9 that prevents the liver from removing LDL cholesterol, the “bad” cholesterol, from the bloodstream.In large clinical trials, evolocumab cut LDL levels by more than 50 percent even in patients already taking other cholesterol medicines.Analysts have forecast multibillion-dollar sales for the new biotech drugs, if they demonstrate an ability to significantly reduce heart attacks and deaths in larger ongoing trials, as statins have.While Amgen was the first to file for U.S. approval of a PCSK9 inhibitor, Regeneron and French partner Sanofi have an ace up their sleeve that could enable them to catch up or even reach the market first with their drug, alirocumab.In late July, the companies said they paid $67.5 million to acquire a special voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical Inc that could assure alirocumab an expedited six-month U.S. regulatory review, rather than the standard 10 months.Pfizer Inc is also developing a PCSK9 inhibitor, but is behind Amgen and Regeneron.Amgen is expected submit approval applications for evolocumab to regulators in Europe and other markets in the coming months.Amgen shares were up 77 cents, or 0.6 percent, at $138.60, while Regeneron shares were off 76 cents, or 0.2 percent, at $349.25 on Nasdaq."

2014-8-31,"Early data suggest Sanofi, Regeneron drug may halve heart risk",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0R006V20140831,"* Good news for new PCSK9 drug class but needs confirmation* Sanofi, Regeneron vying with drugs from Amgen and Pfizer* Data from four alirocumab studies unveiled at ESC congressBARCELONA, Aug 31 (Reuters) - An experimental cholesterol-lowering drug from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals roughly halved the number of heart attacks and strokes in a clinical trial, researchers reported on Sunday.The result is not conclusive, because the analysis was done retrospectively, but it provides the first evidence that targeting a protein known as PCSK9 could slash cardiovascular risks for millions of patients.The injectable drug, alirocumab, is from a new class of medicines, which are also being developed by Amgen and Pfizer. They lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in a new way and are widely expected to reap multibillion-dollar sales.The finding is likely to spur enthusiasm about the drugs, which could reach the market next year, although experts said it still needed to be confirmed in a much larger trial.Sanofi and Regeneron said in July that nine big studies showed consistent LDL reductions with alirocumab, but details from four of these trials have only now been unveiled at the European Society of Cardiology annual meeting in Barcelona.The encouraging cardiovascular data come from an interim safety analysis of one of these studies showing patients on alirocumab were less prone to a combination of cardiovascular events, including cardiac death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalisation.Both groups of patients got traditional anti-cholesterol statin pills in addition to alirocumab or a placebo. Among the alirocumab group, 1.4 percent of patients suffered a major cardiovascular event against 3.0 percent of those on placebo.The ongoing 2,341-patient study, called Odyssey Long Term, is expected to conclude early next year but researchers said the early sign of efficacy was clearly positive.“To have this result emerge so quickly in this study is very encouraging,” said Jennifer Robinson, a cardiologist at the University of Iowa, who led the study.No other drugmaker has previously released data suggesting reduced cardiovascular risk from PCSK9 inhibitors.Patrick O’Gara of the Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and president of the American College of Cardiology said the finding was “biologically plausible” but the post-hoc or retrospective nature of the analysis necessitated caution.“It’s so much wished-for that we must be careful,” he said.Sanofi and Regeneron are in a fierce race with Amgen, which last week became the first company to file with regulators to sell its product evolocumab.The French and U.S. partners hope to close the gap after paying $67.5 million last month for a voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical designed to assure alirocumab an expedited U.S. regulatory review.It is unclear if the rival PCSK9 drugs will prove to be very different from each other but Sanofi’s research head Elias Zerhouni thinks alirocumab should enjoy an early advantage from the preliminary indication of improved cardiovascular results.That may help convince cost-conscious healthcare providers to pay up for an expensive new medicine before results from the large 18,000-patient trial are available in 2017 or 2018.“It has to be confirmed by the big outcomes study but it is the first scientific indication that there is something other than a statin that potentially shows you can get a reduction in risk,” Zerhouni told Reuters.All four trials presented in Barcelona showed alirocumab cut LDL by around 50-60 percent after 24 weeks. Side effects included stuffy nose and upper respiratory tract infections.Doctors and regulatory authorities are watching closely to see if cutting LDL so sharply may have an adverse effect on other parts of the body, notably the brain.So far, there is no sign of this. There was a small non-statistically significant trend towards more neurocognitive problems in Odyssey Long Term but the other three studies showed alirocumab patients had fewer such issues.PCSK9 drugs will be targeted first at people with a rare familial condition that raises their cholesterol dangerously, as well as statin-intolerant patients and those at high-risk of a heart attack who struggle to control LDL on current medicines.Sanofi and Regeneron estimate this high-risk group totals around 21 million patients in the United States and Europe.Whether the drugs, which will be offered in pre-filled syringes and auto-injector pens, will be used more generally depends on how their cost-effective they are deemed to be.The companies say it is premature to talk about price but it is clear the antibody-based therapies will not be cheap, with Barclays analysts suggesting $6,000 a year as a possible price in the United States, with a lower price likely in Europe.

2014-9-01,Pricing is key for new heart drugs challenging cheap generics,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0GW2QJ20140901,"BARCELONA (Reuters) - Doctors looking at highly encouraging clinical trial results for new heart drugs at the world’s largest cardiology meeting this week are missing one piece of data that will be critical to their success - the price.While new treatments on show in Barcelona are certainly moving cardiovascular medicine forward after a series of setbacks in recent years, cardiologists say that cost will be key in determining how widely they are used.“We are entering a new era of treatment and, of course, it will cost a lot of money, which is a problem,” said Michel Bertrand, emeritus professor at the University of Lille and a past president of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).Hopes have spiked for a heart failure drug from Novartis and an innovative class of injectable anti-cholesterol agents known as PCSK9 inhibitors after the release of data at the ESC’s annual meeting indicated that they can save more lives than standard therapies.The pharmaceuticals industry, however, faces a challenge because the new drugs are designed to replace or supplement a range of older medicines that have lost patent protection and are now widely available as bargain-basement generics.Novartis’s new heart failure drug LCZ696, for example, was tested in a pivotal trial against enalapril, a generic drug in the so-called ACE inhibitor class, a month’s supply of which can be bought at Wal-Mart stores for only $4.The Swiss company has yet to say what it will charge for LCZ696, but based on the cost of recently launched drugs such as Bayer and Johnson & Johnson’s anticoagulant Xarelto, analysts expect between $7 and $8 a day - or about $225 a month - with a lower price in Europe.It would be a big price for a big population - heart failure affects about 26 million people across the United States and Europe - and analysts have forecast peak annual sales of $5 billion-plus.Doctors, too, are keen that insurers and governments should see beyond the upfront cost to the long-term benefits.“Unfortunately, many insurance companies focus strictly on the cost of the pill,” Elliott Antman, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and president of the American Heart Association, told Reuters.“But if we only look at the per-pill cost we have blinders on. We have to think about the impact on the health-delivery system overall - and if a more expensive new drug reduces symptoms to the extent that patients aren’t hospitalized as much, then that has enormous economic impact.”That chimes with the message from Novartis pharmaceuticals head David Epstein, who argues that the cost of a generic “is not the way to think about this product”.Still, with LCZ696 now in a position to replace an array of cheap medicines that have been the mainstay of heart failure treatment for more than 20 years, many cardiologists expect inevitable delays as healthcare providers haggle over access.“A lot of payers will probably initially deny this because of costs,” said Alfred Bove, emeritus professor at Temple University. “Normally it takes about two years for something like this to get ingrained into routine care.”While LCZ696 may involve wholesale switching of treatment, the emerging class of PCSK9 agents present a different cost-effectiveness challenge.They are designed to complement existing drugs, such as statins, and are likely to cost about twice as much as LCZ696 because they are complex biotech products that have to be injected, according to industry analysts.Sanofi, working with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is racing Amgen to bring the first PCSK9 drug to market in 2015, with Pfizer lagging slightly behind.Once again the data is looking good, but in this case cardiologists expect uptake to be much more targeted, initially focused on people with a rare familial condition that raises their cholesterol dangerously, as well as high-risk and statin-intolerant patients.“I think doctors will be quite cautious and I would expect a very stratified approach,” said the University of Edinburgh’s Keith Fox, who chairs the ESC’s congress program committee. “I don’t see these drugs going out in the same broad way as statins.”However, this high-risk group alone totals about 21 million in the United States and Europe, Sanofi estimates, pointing to a multibillion-dollar sales opportunity.For cardiologists, the expected launch next year of two important types of treatment is a breath of fresh air. Heart medicine has recently been eclipsed by advances in oncology, with U.S. regulators approving five new cancer drugs this year against only one for cardiovascular conditions.What is more, some heart drugs launched in recent years have not been used as widely as initially hoped, including AstraZeneca’s Brilinta and Pfizer and Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Eliquis, a rival to Xarelto.These drugs, however, did not offer the innovative mechanisms used with LCZ696 or PCSK9, which Freek Verheugt, of the Rotterdam Thorax Center, says should make a difference when the success stories from Barcelona finally reach patients.“A brand new thing that saves lives should be adopted quickly,” he said."

The companies have denied any wrongdoing.In France, Avastin costs about 30 euros ($38.84) per dose, against the 900 euros charged for an injection of Lucentis.Novartis and Roche have always discouraged the substitution of Avastin for Lucentis, saying that the two drugs were developed for different therapeutic purposes.A closely watched U.S. government-sponsored study in 2011 concluded that Avastin worked as well as Lucentis in treating vision loss from wAMD but had more adverse side effects.However, the Cochrane paper found that the safety of Avastin when used in wAMD appeared to be comparable with that of Lucentis, except for a higher rate of gastrointestinal disorders.David Tovey, editor in chief of the Cochrane Library, said the review addressed a question of “immense importance to health systems in many countries”.The Cochrane researchers noted, however, that their findings were not definitive and that they now plan to conduct a larger review to assess additional sources of evidence.Novartis said in a statement that Lucentis had a well-known safety profile with more than 2.8 million patient-treatment years of use globally. Avastin’s use in the eye, by contrast, has not been systematically reviewed by health authorities.Roche said it believed that Lucentis is the most appropriate medicine for wAMD, adding that the Cochrane review appears to be based on studies that were not designed to detect differences related to safety aspects.Lucentis is marketed by Novartis outside the United States and is the company’s third-biggest seller, with $2.4 billion in sales last year.

2014-9-19,Regeneron says allergy drug may be darling of its pipeline,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0HE29G20140919,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc has quickly become one of the world’s biggest biotech companies thanks to its Eylea treatment for macular degeneration, but its little known experimental allergy drug could become equally successful, senior company executives said in interviews.The allergy drug, dupilumab, is meant to treat underlying causes of asthma, eczema and nasal polyps and could transform treatment of those suspected related ailments, the officials say.“We have a lot of debate within the company as to which of our many programs is the most exciting, and a lot of people are voting on dupilumab,” Regeneron research chief George Yancopoulos said in an interview at company headquarters.The other contender is a new type of cholesterol treatment, called alirocumab, which Regeneron expects to submit for regulatory approval later this year.Dupilumab works by blocking IL-4 and IL-13, two immune system proteins that attack healthy tissue and cause inflammation in different parts of the body. The medicine, co-developed with French drugmaker Sanofi, slashed asthma flareups by 87 percent in a mid-stage trial described last year.A measurement of eczema symptoms and surface area involvement diminished by 45 to 74 percent in a separate mid-stage trial of dupilumab described in July. It involved patients with moderate to severe atopic dermatitis, a chronic type of eczema.Data from mid-stage trials of the drug against nasal polyps - growths that impair smell, breathing and sleeping and which are linked to sinus infections - are expected in coming months and could give a fuller portrait of dupilumab’s potential.“If dupilumab is equally impressive against nasal polyps, I think it will nail the hypothesis that this spectrum of allergic diseases are all inter-related variations of the same disease” and due to the inflammation-causing proteins, Yancopoulos said.Millions of people worldwide suffer from various combinations of asthma, nasal polyps and atopic dermatitis, pointing to potential high demand for dupilumab, Yancopoulos said.Regeneron was an obscure biotech in the northern suburbs of New York City until late 2011, when it introduced its Eylea treatment for macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.With its more convenient dosing schedule, Eylea quickly stole market share from Roche Holding AG’s Lucentis, and is expected to have sales this year of $1.8 billion. Regeneron’s market capitalization, now $37 billion, has tracked Eylea’s rise.Regeneron hopes next summer to introduce alirocumab, which lowers cholesterol by blocking a protein called PCSK9. It is also being co-developed with Sanofi and expected to compete with a similar drug being developed by Amgen Inc. Analysts expect each of the drugs to generate annual sales of $2 billion or more, if approved.But Michael Aberman, head of business development at Regeneron, said dupilumab may have even greater sales potential than alirocumab if it performs well in ongoing late-stage studies and is approved.“It could be bigger,” Aberman said, “because we believe we’re getting at the crux of all these diseases” linked to allergies."
2014-9-26,"Alimera, pSivida eye implant finally wins U.S. approval",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0RR5MT20140926,"(Adds detail, shares)Sept 26 (Reuters) - Alimera Sciences Inc and pSivida Corp said the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved their vision-loss treatment Iluvien, following three rejections.Alimera’s shares jumped about 16 percent to $5.95, while pSivida rose about 10.5 percent to $4.73 in extended trading.Iluvien will treat a condition known as diabetic macular edema (DME), a swelling on the back of the retina that in the most severe cases can lead to blindness.Iluvien, which will compete with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Eylea and Roche AG’s Lucentis, is expected to be available in the United States in early 2015.“The FDA’s approval of Iluvien is not limited, as in the EU, to the subset of patients with chronic DME, patients who have failed other therapies, or patients who have had cataract surgery,” pSivida CEO Paul Ashton said in a statement on Friday.The company licensed the implant to Alimera in February 2005 and will receive a milestone payment of $25 million following the approval.PSivida is also entitled to get 20 percent of the profits from U.S. sales.Iluvien, already available in the UK and Germany, is an injectable implant. The treatment involves positioning a tiny, cylindrical tube containing a drug in the back of the eye - the spot where DME typically forms.A single injection of Iluvien provides sustained treatment of DME for 36 months, compared to standard treatments that need to be administered as frequently as monthly, pSivida said.Eylea, which also needs to be injected into the eye, received expanded approval for DME on July 29.

The drug was named “clinical advance of the year” in 2013 by industry publication Scrip Intelligence, and some analysts say it could capture annual sales of up to $2 billion if approved.Chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps causes inflammation of the mucosa and polyps in the nasal cavity and sinuses, resulting in congestion, a reduced sense of smell and facial pain.Patients gain limited relief from intranasal corticosteroids, the only therapy currently available. Dupilumab works through a new approach, by blocking two proteins linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13)Sanofi said the findings of the trial on 60 adults with moderate-to-severe disease, combined with previous encouraging Phase II data for dupilumab in asthma and atopic dermatitis, supported evidence that these conditions may result from a core allergic inflammatory process driven by the IL-4/IL-13 pathway.About 30 percent of patients with chronic sinusitis with nasal polyps also have asthma, and in an exploratory analysis, dupilumab-treated patients with both conditions also experienced significant improvement in asthma control, Sanofi noted.The drug’s main side effects were injection site reactions, common cold, sore throat, nosebleed, headache and dizziness.Sanofi said it would present detailed results of the study at a medical conference and pursue further clinical trials."

It compared a 300 mg dose of the drug given every four weeks against a placebo, with over two-thirds of the patients also on statins.A second study evaluated alirocumab in 233 high cholesterol patients with a high heart risk and/or a history of being unable to tolerate two or more statins. The trial compared a 150 mg dose of the drug given every four weeks against a placebo.Early data from another trial suggested alirocumab could halve heart risk. A study also proved that the number of high-risk statin-intolerant patients able to get their “bad” cholesterol down using alirocumab was 10 times more than those on Merck & Co’s Zetia.Regeneron’s stock was up 1.3 percent at $408.41 in morning trading on the Nasdaq on Friday.

But Express deemed the more than $90,000 price for 12 weeks of Harvoni treatment unaffordable.The move reignited investor concerns that drugmakers will have to bow to pricing pressure from U.S. insurers and lawmakers over novel medications whose cost can reach hundreds of thousands of dollars for some diseases.For cancer patients, treatment decisions typically go through health insurance plans first, and medicines are not changed once people have begun their regimens, Express Scripts Chief Executive George Paz said at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco. He said PBMs should be included in the decision-making process at a much earlier stage.“The big opportunity out there is really in cancer,” Paz said. “If we can get out in front of that, that is a huge opportunity.”Paz said he is also focused on a new crop of cholesterol-lowering drugs expected to hit the market this year, and is talking to companies about market share, positioning and pricing.“They are pretty astonishing, but they are also very expensive,” Paz said of the drugs which target a protein known as PCSK9. Manufacturers include Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi .

It’s a reality that we will deal with,” Schleifer said. “I think there will be fair pricing and healthy competition in the marketplace.” (Reporting by Susan Kelly in Chicago and Bill Berkrot in New York; Editing by Christian Plumb, Bernard Orr)"

Morgan Healthcare conference in San Francisco.He said animal trials of the experimental PCSK9 pill have demonstrated “a substantial reduction” in cholesterol.Trials of Pfizer’s experimental drug bococizumab, a large-molecule antibody that is given by injection every two weeks, have shown that it lowers cholesterol by around 60 percent.“We view this as a franchise approach,” Dolsten said.He expects Pfizer’s experimental PCSK9 vaccine, designed to induce the body to produce its own PCSK9 antibodies, to enter human testing in 2016.“Imagine going to your doctor to get a shot for cholesterol,” he said, noting that, if successful, the vaccine might eventually be an annual injection.Amgen Inc, as well as a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA, are also developing antibody drugs that target PCSK9. Wall Street analysts have forecast that each of the three could reach peak annual sales near $2 billion.This current crop of PCSK9 inhibitors are monoclonal antibodies, proteins grown in living cells that need to be given by injection. They work differently from statins - pills that inhibit the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.The injected drugs are being developed to treat patients who can’t tolerate statins, or whose cholesterol cannot be controlled with the older drugs.Dolsten said a PCSK9 pill might eventually be used for people with moderate to high cholesterol, while an antibody might be needed for those whose cholesterol is still very high despite the use of statins."

The stock traded as high as $68 in January 2014.Calls for Beer’s ouster present yet another challenge to the embattled CEO, who became embroiled in a messy divorce battle involving Jefferies Group LLC head healthcare banker Sage Kelly, who has since resigned. Kelly’s wife alleged in divorce papers that Beer was part of a group of executives who partied with the banker using illegal drugs, according to press reports.Beer and Kelly have both denied the allegations and Kelly’s wife eventually rescinded some of a broad range of accusations after reaching a settlement with her husband.The large shareholders believe Aegerion should consider selling itself to a larger pharmaceutical and biotech company such as Shire Plc SHP.L, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc JAZZ.O, Amgen Inc AMGN.O or Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O, the sources said.Aegerion set high expectations for Juxtapid and then lowered its 2014 net sales forecasts for the drug several times throughout the year, citing an increased number of patients discontinuing therapy and lower U.S. prescription growth.After initially forecasting the drug’s sales could range from $180 million to $200 million, the company cut its forecast to the low end of that range, and then revised it down again in October to $150 million to $160 million.Some large shareholders have also questioned Aegerion’s decision in November to acquire Myalept, a drug used to treat a fat tissue disorder, rather than buying back stock to boost the biotech’s lagging share price, the sources said.While the sources declined to specify which of the top 10 investors are seeking Beer’s ouster, Aegerion’s biggest shareholders include Scopia Capital Management, Boston-based Fidelity Investments, Putnam Investments and Westfield Capital Management LP.In a regulatory filing on Monday, Aegerion disclosed it was being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission for sales and disclosure activities related to Juxtapid.Rare diseases remain an attractive area of focus for pharmaceutical companies because there are fewer hurdles to regulatory approval, marketing costs are lower and drug prices are higher than with mainstream drugs.Recent M&A deals in the rare disease space include Shire's $5.2 billion acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc NPSP.O on Monday and its $4.2 billion acquisition of ViroPharma in 2013."

Kelly’s wife alleged in divorce papers that Beer was part of a group of executives who partied with Kelly using illegal drugs, according to press reports.Beer and Kelly have both denied the allegations and Kelly’s wife eventually rescinded some of the accusations after reaching a settlement with her husband.The large shareholders believe Aegerion should consider selling itself to a larger pharmaceutical and biotech company such as Shire Plc, Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc, Amgen Inc or Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, the sources said.Aegerion set high expectations for Juxtapid and then lowered its 2014 net sales forecasts for the drug several times throughout the year, citing an increased number of patients discontinuing therapy and lower U.S. prescription growth.After initially forecasting the drug’s sales could range from $180 million to $200 million, the company cut its forecast to the low end of that range, and then revised it down again in October to $150 million to $160 million."

2015-1-26,Regeneron\\/Sanofi cholesterol drug gets FDA priority review,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0V22A320150126,"Jan 26 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals on Monday said U.S. health regulators accepted its application to review a potent cholesterol drug on a priority basis, potentially giving it the upper hand in a fierce race with Amgen to bring a new medicine from the promising class to market.Regeneron, which is developing the drug, alirocumab, in partnership with Sanofi, said the target date for a Food and Drug Administration approval decision was July 24, following a six-month review period.That could put the medicine on the U.S. market a month ahead of Amgen’s rival evolocumab. Amgen was first to file its application, but received a standard 10-month review from the FDA, giving it an action date of Aug 27.Regeneron and Sanofi, which were seen as lagging Amgen, employed an unusual strategy to catch up, purchasing a special priority review voucher from BioMarin Pharmaceutical for $67.5 million.The drugs belong to a highly promising new class called PCSK9 inhibitors that block a protein that prevents the liver from removing bad LDL cholesterol from the blood. In clinical trials, they have shown an ability to lower LDL levels by more than 50 percent.The injectable biotech medicines are expected to be used in high-risk heart patients who are unable to tolerate statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, or those who cannot get LDL levels low enough with statins. They are expected to be expensive, with analysts forecasting annual sales of $3 billion for each of the drugs.Pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding said it was looking at the class with an eye toward negotiating a lower price from one company in exchange for priority status on its formulary for its millions of customers. Express used the strategy with new hepatitis C treatments, getting a lower price from AbbVie and excluding Gilead’s drugs.The first company to bring a PCSK9 drug to market would not only have a period to launch the medicine without competition, but would set the price for the class. Pfizer is also working on a PCSK9 drug that will likely be third to market.Regeneron and Sanofi submitted an application for European approval of alirocumab earlier this month. The companies have proposed the brand name Praluent for their product once approved. (Reporting by Bill Berkrot; Editing by Leslie Adler)"

2015-1-30,U.S. proposes effort to analyze DNA from 1 million people,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0L313R20150130,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States has proposed analyzing genetic information from more than 1 million American volunteers as part of a new initiative to understand human disease and develop medicines targeted to an individual’s genetic make-up.At the heart of the “precision medicine” initiative, announced on Friday by President Barack Obama, is the creation of a pool of people - healthy and ill, men and women, old and young - who would be studied to learn how genetic variants affect health and disease.Officials hope genetic data from several hundred thousand participants in ongoing genetic studies would be used and other volunteers recruited to reach the 1 million total.“Precision medicine gives us one of the greatest opportunities for new medical breakthroughs we’ve ever seen,” Obama said, promising that it would “lay a foundation for a new era of life-saving discoveries.”The near-term goal is to create more and better treatments for cancer, Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), told reporters on a conference call on Thursday. Longer term, he said, the project would provide information on how to individualize treatment for a range of diseases.The initial focus on cancer, he said, reflects the lethality of the disease and the significant advances against cancer that precision medicine has already made, though more work is needed.The president proposed $215 million in his 2016 budget for the initiative. Of that, $130 million would go to the NIH to fund the research cohort and $70 million to NIH’s National Cancer Institute to intensify efforts to identify molecular drivers of cancer and apply that knowledge to drug development.A further $10 million would go to the Food and Drug Administration to develop databases on which to build an appropriate regulatory structure; $5 million would go to the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology to develop privacy standards and ensure the secure exchange of data.The effort may raise alarm bells for privacy rights advocates who have questioned the government’s ability to guarantee that DNA information is kept anonymous.Obama promised that “privacy will be built in from day one.”The funding is not nearly enough to sequence 1 million genomes from scratch. Whole-genome sequencing, though plummeting in price, still costs about $1,000 per genome, Collins said, meaning this component alone would cost $1 billion.Instead, he said, the national cohort would be assembled both from new volunteers interested in “an opportunity to take part in something historic,” and existing cohorts that are already linking genomic data to medical outcomes.The most ambitious of these is the Million Veteran Program, launched in 2011 by the Department of Veterans Affairs. Aimed at making genomic discoveries and bringing personalized medicine to veterans, it has enrolled more than 300,000 veterans and determined DNA sequences of about 200,000.The VA was a pioneer in electronic health records, which it will use to link the genotypes to vets’ medical histories.Academic centers have, with NIH funding, also amassed thousands of genomes and linked them to the risk of disease and other health outcomes. The Electronic Medical Records and Genomics Network, announced by NIH in 2007, aims to combine DNA information on more than 300,000 people and look for connections to diseases as varied as autism, appendicitis, cataracts, diabetes and dementia.In 2014, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc launched a collaboration with Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health System to sequence the DNA of 100,000 Geisinger patients and, using their anonymous medical records, look for correlations between genes and disease. The company is sequencing 50,000 samples per year, spokeswoman Hala Mirza said.“NAIVE ASSUMPTION”Perhaps the most audacious effort is by the non-profit Human Longevity Inc, headed by Craig Venter. In 2013 it launched a project to sequence 1 million genomes by 2020. Privately funded, it will be made available to pharmaceutical companies such as Roche Holding AG.“We’re happy to work with them to help move the science,” Venter said in an interview, referring to the administration’s initiative.But because of regulations surrounding medical privacy, he said, “we can’t just mingle databases. It sounds like a naive assumption” if the White House expects existing cohorts to merge into its 1 million-genomes project.Venter raced the government-funded Human Genome Project to a draw in 2000, sequencing the entire human genome using private funding in less time than it took the public effort.Collins conceded that mingling the databases would be a challenge but insisted it is doable.“It is something that can be achieved but obviously there is a lot that needs to be done,” he said.Collating, analyzing and applying the data to develop drugs will require changes to how products are reviewed and approved by health regulators.Dr. Margaret Hamburg, the FDA’s commissioner, said precision medicine “presents a set of new issues for us at FDA.” The agency is discussing new ways to approach the review process for personalized medicines and tests, she added."
2015-10-02,EXCLUSIVE-US insurers hold back Lilly\'s death-defying diabetes drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1211PP20151002,"NEW YORK, Oct 2 (Reuters) - America’s largest health insurers are urging doctors to stick with current standard treatments for diabetes instead of flocking to a new drug from Eli Lilly & Co that is showing it can provide life-saving results for one-third of patients.Aetna Inc, CVS Health Corp and Molina Healthcare Inc said they would need further clinical data and a change in medical society guidelines on Lilly’s Jardiance before agreeing to make it easier for patients to receive the $4,800-a-year treatment. That’s a process that could take anywhere from 18 months to several years.UnitedHealth Group Inc, Anthem Inc, Express Scripts and Cigna Corp said they would also still adhere to the traditional treatment regime based largely on cheaper generic drugs and carefully review the data before making any changes.Their stance is likely to disappoint investors who are betting that Jardiance will leap from $11 million in global sales last quarter to $5 billion annually by 2020. Lilly reported last month that Jardiance slashed cardiovascular deaths by 38 percent in patients with type 2 diabetes, leading Wall Street analysts to predict it would become widely used in the United States. How the drug does this is a mystery given its mild benefits of lowering blood pressure, blood sugar and weight.“It always makes me nervous when we have a drug that we can’t explain,” said Dr. J. Mario Molina, who runs Medicaid provider Molina Healthcare based in Long Beach, California. “Before we rush out and adopt this on a wide basis, we need more studies and other drugs tested as well.”Lilly shares rose nearly 10 percent when it disclosed the Jardiance data, but have since given back those gains amid a wider selloff among biotech stocks. Lilly and its partner, German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, sponsored the Jardiance trial, which was conducted in hospitals and research centers in 42 countries.But the cumulative costs of treating the large number of patients with type 2 diabetes - the most common form, with 24 million sufferers in the U.S. -- year after year is giving insurers pause, adding to a debate over whether the high price of U.S. medicines is justified by their ability to fight disease. Most patients with type 2 diabetes, which is highly linked to obesity, die of heart disease.Competing drugs such as Merck & Co’s Januvia or Novo Nordisk’s Victoza carry similar price tags to Jardiance. Doctors may want to prescribe Jardiance instead of those therapies, which have not shown the same ability to prevent deaths from heart attack or stroke. Jardiance, approved last year, may also replace other drugs, such as generic sulfonylureas.They may turn to Jardiance earlier on, or even use it instead of metformin, the $60-a-month generic that is usually the first prescription written for a diabetic.Insurers allow their members to use Jardiance or others in the same class but typically charge a higher patient co-payment and may reimburse its use only after metformin is taken for a number of months.JPMorgan analyst Chris Schott said in a note he expects the Jardiance data to drive growth over time and will be watching for prescriptions to pick up in late 2016 or 2017. He expects 2016 sales to rise to $837 million.Other potential uses for the drug could add millions of more prescriptions not yet factored in by Wall Street. The results on diabetic patients are leading cardiologists to consider testing the drug on non-diabetics at risk of heart disease. The American Heart Association will feature a discussion of Jardiance’s prospects at its annual meeting in November.Insurers, who were as surprised by the data as the investors, said Wall Street should slow down. Many want to see if a similar treatment from Johnson & Johnson, Invokana, shows comparable benefits in clinical trial results expected in 2017.That would give insurers a stronger case to pit Lilly and the makers of similar drugs against each other, a tactic they employed with Gilead Sciences Inc’s blockbuster hepatitis C treatment Sovaldi earlier this year after a competitor hit the market. They have also enforced coverage policies that are slowing down the expansion of new cholesterol fighters from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.David Kendall, vice president of medical affairs for Lilly’s diabetes franchise, said he hopes insurers will allow greater use of Jardiance as soon as possible, and that medical societies will promptly update their treatment guidelines to prescribe Jardiance instead of other treatments.“We would hope undue delay isn’t an outcome; we would hope for timely decision-making,” Kendall said.Jardiance, a pill taken once daily, is among the class of drugs known as SGLT2 inhibitors which work by helping the kidneys excrete more excess glucose in urine. This class of drugs can produce side effects including a higher rate of infection and a potentially fatal condition involving excess acid in the blood.The global market for SGLT2 inhibitors reached $400 million last year, with Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca Plc in the lead, according to brokerage Cowen and Co. Generic pills and insulin are the most widely used treatments in the $36 billion global diabetes drug market.“It could be 2017 before insurance companies will advocate this as a preferred agent,” said Dr. Carol Wysham, head of the diabetes and endocrinology department at Rockwood Clinic in Spokane, Washington. “They aren’t going to do anything until they have to.”CVS, like other insurers, wants to hear from the nation’s top medical groups on diabetes and see the results of more studies. In addition to Johnson & Johnson’s long-term Invokana study, AstraZeneca is conducting a study on Farxiga, which is due in 2019. Either one could suggest whether Jardiance alone prevents death in a high percentage of diabetes patients, or whether it is a shared trait of the drug class.“There is a lot more to be gained in making sure that people are taking older, less expensive drugs than there is in adding new more expensive drugs into the mix,” CVS Health Chief Medical Officer Dr. Troyen Brennan said in an interview, referring to the problem of patients skipping on their medications. “I see no indication from this study of a wholesale change in the treatment outline.”The American Diabetes Association, the Joslin Diabetes Center and the Endocrine Society said they need to gather specialist doctors and review the data to consider whether to draft new treatment guidelines, a process that would likely take a year or two.Aetna’s chief medical officer for pharmacy, Dr. Edmund Pezalla, described the data as a “pleasant surprise” and said Jardiance has the potential to save medical costs for patients down the road.The company, which prefers customers use J&J’s Invokana over Jardiance, is preparing for an increase in use. “We probably are not going to see everybody going onto these medications,” Pezalla said. “We do see changes in utilization when studies that are positive come out.”Dr. Steve Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, treats diabetes as part of his cardiology practice. He has never prescribed Jardiance but said he would probably do so now, beginning gradually and prescribing it earlier than current guidelines suggest.“I try to be responsible about cost-effective prescribing, but most people are not controlled on metformin alone,” he said.

2015-10-06,Express Scripts sees $750 million in spending on new cholesterol drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0S02SV20151006,"(Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers and health plans, said it has reached deals to cover two costly new cholesterol drugs and expects to spend no more than $750 million on them next year.The injected drugs - Repatha from Amgen Inc and Praluent from partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi - each have list prices of more than $14,000 a year.They were approved by U.S. regulators during the summer and belong to a new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors that can slash “bad” LDL cholesterol by more than 60 percent.Express Scripts, which has been a vocal critic of rising U.S. drug prices, would not comment on how much of a discount it had negotiated. It says total U.S. spending on the new drugs could reach $10 billion next year, far beyond Wall Street forecasts.Express Scripts said its agreements with PCSK9 drugmakers include rebates, restrictions on who can receive the therapy, protections against price increases and a spending cap. It noted that drugmakers in the past would not provide a discount to insurers that limited a drug’s use.“But this time, we have been able to put in place strong utilization management to make sure only patients that meet (U.S.) label criteria get on the drug and we get a discount on top of that,” said Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller. “We are confident that we have received the best price possible for both products, without needing to exclude either.”The agreements are part of Express Scripts’ National Preferred Formulary list of drugs, which covers 25 million Americans.Wall Street analysts forecast 2016 sales of between $157 million and $609 million for Repatha and between $211 million and $911 million for Praluent, with sales of each seen rising to $2.3 billion by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis.Express Scripts said that statins, many now available as low cost generics, remain the most appropriate therapy for the large majority of the more than 70 million Americans with high cholesterol.U.S. health regulators have said that PCSK9 treatments should be used by a much smaller group of people with an inherited form of very high cholesterol, or people at high risk of heart attack or stroke who cannot control cholesterol with statins alone.But the drugs may be used more widely over time. Amgen and Regeneron/Sanofi are conducting clinical trials to show that their PCSK9 medicines can lower the risk of heart attack, stroke and other serious heart problems.If a study were to show that PCSK9s are a primary way to prevent serious heart problems, “obviously that increases the patient population enormously,” Miller said.Amgen said in a statement that it continues “to engage constructively with other payers to enable patients to have access to Repatha,” while Sanofi/Regeneron said, “we are dedicated to establishing agreements with insurers.”"

2015-10-12,Merck cholesterol drug\'s odds dim after Lilly failure,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N12C1GN20151013,"Oct 12 (Reuters) - The odds that Merck & Co’s high-stakes cholesterol drug will succeed have dropped dramatically after Eli Lilly and Co said its similar medicine failed to reduce heart attacks and strokes, top U.S. heart doctors said.Lilly on Monday said it was halting a 12,000-patient study of its drug, evacetrapib, an oral medication. In earlier studies, the treatment cut “bad” LDL cholesterol by 30 to 35 percent and doubled the levels of “good” LDL cholesterol. But the influence on cholesterol levels did not ultimately improve patients’ health, dashing hopes for this approach to treating heart disease.Merck’s anacetrapib is now the only drug in a novel class known as CETP inhibitors that remains in late-stage trials. Data from a 30,000-patient study is expected by 2017 to show whether it reduces the incidence of heart attack and strokes. Wall Street analysts have estimated the drug could reap eventual annual sales of up to $10 billion, if approved.But with the outlook dimmed for CETP inhibitors, Wall Street analysts on Monday predicted a boost to a competing class of drugs just approved for the U.S. market that work by sharply lowering LDL cholesterol. Shares in Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals rose on expectations the Lilly decision removed a competitive threat to sales of their injectable drugs, which block a protein called PCSK9.“CETP inhibitors as legitimate drug targets are dead as of today,” said Dr. P.K. Shah, director of atherosclerosis research at Cedars-Sinai Heart Center in Los Angeles, referring to Lilly’s setback. “For cardiologists looking for heart protection, these drugs were a dream, but they haven’t come true.”Dr. Steve Nissen, head of cardiology for the Cleveland Clinic, noted that Lilly’s failure follows the demise of two other high-profile drugs in the same class. Pfizer’s Inc’s torcetrapib was discontinued in 2006 due to safety worries, while Roche Holding AG’s dalcetrapib was terminated in 2012 for lack of benefit.“In baseball you don’t get four strikes,” he said of prospects for Merck’s candidate. Nissen was chairman of the halted Lilly study, which involved trials at 540 sites in 37 countries.Merck, in an emailed statement, said it looks forward to better understanding Lilly’s decision to pull the plug on evacetrapib, but remains confident in its own drug’s potential success.CETP inhibitors block a protein that transfers HDL cholesterol to LDL cholesterol, resulting in higher levels of HDL and lower LDL levels. Statins, by contrast, work by reducing the liver’s production of cholesterol.Amgen and Regeneron’s treatments work by blocking a protein named PSCK9 whose normal function in the body is to maximize the presence of LDL cholesterol that enters the bloodstream.However, investors are still waiting for proof that PCSK9 inhibitors actually reduce heart attacks and strokes, and don’t just reduce cholesterol. Data from such an “outcomes” trial for Regeneron’s Praluent are expected by late 2016, while those from Repatha’s trial are due in 2017.Dr. Allen Taylor, chief of cardiology at MedStar Heart and Vascular Institute in Washington, D.C., said it would be unwise to assume the PCSK9 inhibitors are heart-protective just because they slash LDL levels.“Until you see the trial results, all bets are off,” he said.Should Merck’s own outcomes data for anacetrapib prove positive, the pill could be a much preferred method for patients over the injections required for PCSK9 treatments.Lilly shares closed down 7.8 percent on Monday. Merck slipped 0.5 percent. Regeneron shares jumped 4.5 percent, while its PCSK9 partner, Sanofi SA, rose 1.3 percent in Paris. Amgen shares rose 2.4 percent.

2015-10-12,"Eli Lilly halts study of heart drug, stock tumbles",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0S61BV20151012,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co has stopped a late-stage trial of its closely watched cholesterol treatment after it proved ineffective, sending its stock down more than 9 percent and casting greater skepticism over the potentially lucrative class of medicines.The setback, announced by the company on Monday, also hit shares of Merck & Co Inc, which is now the only major drugmaker still moving aggressively ahead with a member of the novel family of drugs called CETP inhibitors.“Today’s news is a negative for Lilly and we anticipate that investors will also likely read across negatively for Merck,” Evercore ISI analyst Mark Schoenebaum said in a research note. Merck stock fell as much as 2.5 percent.Lilly’s drug evacetrapib, like rival CETP inhibitors, is meant to sharply raise “good” HDL cholesterol while cutting levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol. Current cholesterol fighters called statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, prevent artery-clogging by slashing LDL levels, but have little impact on heart-protective HDL.Lilly said it stopped the evacetrapib study on the recommendation of an independent data-monitoring committee, which cited insufficient efficacy of the drug. The study was not stopped due to safety concerns, Lilly added.Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford had been counting on evacetrapib to be approved in 2017 and generate eventual annual sales of $5 billion for Lilly. He now expects no sales from the drug, even though Lilly will continue to test it in smaller ongoing studies.Pfizer’s CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, was scrapped in 2006 after being linked to deaths in a large $800 million study, dashing the company’s hopes it would be approved and generate annual sales of over $10 billion. A second CETP inhibitor, Roche Holding AG’s dalcetrapib, was ditched in 2012 due to lack of benefit.Merck is conducting a late-stage trial of its candidate, anacetrapib, that is expected to conclude in 2017.In mid-stage studies, the Merck drug raised HDL levels by a whopping 138 percent, while cutting LDL by 40 percent. But the big question is whether it will safely reduce deaths, heart attacks and strokes - goals that have eluded its rivals.Analysts said Merck’s drug is the only major remaining CETP inhibitor and remains a potential strong competitor to two recently approved cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors that can slash LDL levels 60 percent beyond reductions seen with statins alone.The PCSK9 inhibitors are Praluent from Regeneron Inc and Sanofi, and Repatha from Amgen Inc, both deemed potential blockbusters.Indianapolis-based Lilly is conducting no other late-stage trials of cardiovascular drugs, one of its seven key areas.Lilly said it will take a charge of up to $90 million, or 5 cents per share, in its fourth quarter due to the setback.Lilly shares were down 8 percent to $79.22 on the New York Stock Exchange. Merck shares were down 0.6 percent to $50.64 at midday."
2015-10-26,Sanofi\'s new CEO set to deliver revival plan after falling diabetes sales,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N12L5JM20151026,"PARIS, Oct 26 (Reuters) - Sanofi’s new chief executive is expected to show how he aims to get France’s most valuable company back on track, after being hit by lagging diabetes sales and boardroom rows, when he presents his five-year strategic plan on Nov. 6.Previously in charge of Germany’s Bayer HealthCare, Olivier Brandicourt, 59, took the helm of the drugmaker in April, six months after the sacking of predecessor Chris Viehbacher who had clashed with the board over strategy and complaints of failing to communicate adequately.Brandicourt will also have to meet shareholder demands for the company to remain diversified while controlling costs and keeping a look-out for acquisitions.Most immediately Sanofi faces growing competition in the treatment of diabetes, especially in the United States, the world’s biggest pharmaceutical market.The company warned in April that sales in its diabetes division, one of its major revenue and profit earners, would fall this year.And Toujeo, a next-generation insulin launched at the end of March in the U.S to follow patent-expiring blockbuster Lantus, is still expected to weigh on costs.The company also has other strategic commercial launches it needs to succeed with, such as an anti-cholesterol drug, Praluent, which has recently secured approval in the U.S and the European Union, and dupilumab, a monoclonal antibody designed for the treatment of skin diseases and asthma.Industry analysts believe that still gives Brandicourt scope to cut costs and to refuel the drug pipeline using a balance sheet that is stronger than many European rivals.While investors will be invited to a day of presentations in Paris on Nov 6, some details could emerge as soon as this week when Sanofi publishes third-quarter results on Thursday.“We see upside potential from new CEO Brandicourt’s first strategic update, for which market expectations remain moderate but which could bring potential cost savings in the new, simpler organisation,” Morgan Stanley analysts said in a recent research note.In July, Sanofi announced a simplified structure from next January built around five global business units (GBU).“If the company still wants to remain diversified, the model needs to be agile,” said Vincent Genet, a partner with consulting firm Alcimed, citing the need for more effort to cut costs and simplify operations in the group’s divisions.The company is also hoping to clinch a deal with unions to boost productivity at its French plants by 20-25 percent over three years, union sources told Reuters on Oct 7.“A 5 percent cost trim could boost 2017 earnings per share by 11 percent and by 8 percent over 2017-21,” Morgan Stanley said. In 2014, Sanofi reported “business” earnings per share, which stripes amortisation, impairment and other costs, of 5.2 euros.Shares in Sanofi are up around 21 percent so far this year compared with a 14 percent rise in the Stoxx 600 Europe Health Care sector index.Morgan Stanley analysts also say the group has the capacity to raise total debt of up to $40 billion for possible acquisitions, four years after buying Genzyme - a Massachusetts-based company which focuses on rare diseases like multiple sclerosis - for $20.1 billion.“Should Sanofi use this firepower to buy a company close to current multiples, we calculate that a theoretical earnings per share accretion of around 20 percent ... in around five years”, they said.“We expect ... Brandicourt to elaborate on how and which types of deals could be done, and envisage a continuation of company’s current strategy of mid-size acquisitions rather than one larger acquisition,” they added.But so far, Brandicourt has kept investors guessing about his exact intentions.During Sanofi’s general meeting in May he said the company needed to remain competitive in the areas where it “can and must win” and pledged Sanofi would maintain a broad product portfolio whereas other European competitors such as Switzerland’s Roche or Denmark’s Novo Nordisk have chosen to specialise.Brandicourt also said he would meet with Sanofi’s main shareholders - led by French cosmetic giant L’Oreal with a 9 percent stake.L’Oreal has said on numerous occasions it considers its holding in Sanofi to be solely “financial”.And analysts say while the company wants to remain diversified management could yet decide to sell some non-core businesses such as generics or animal health to help fund expansion in other areas such as oncology, where Sanofi has teamed up with U.S Regeneron.When working at both Pfizer and at Bayer Brandicourt managed a number of divestments which analysts have described in the past as successful, including Pfizer’s sale of animal health unit Zoetis as well as Bayer’s blood glucose monitoring business.

North America accounted for 26 percent of group sales.Bayer’s non-prescription treatments revenue jumped 42 percent to 1.4 billion euros following the purchase of Merck & Co’s consumer health business, with only 1.7 percent growth left after deducting the effects of that deal and of currency changes.Bayer, which plans to sever ties with its separately listed plastics business Covestro, still expects 2015 adjusted EBITDA to grow by “a high-teens percentage”, including positive currency effects of about 4 percent.It lowered its 2015 revenue target to roughly 46 billion euros from 47 billion euros previously, anticipating less of a boost from currency effects than previously."

2015-11-18,UK cost watchdog turns down Amgen\'s new cholesterol drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N13D3YI20151118,"(Adds Amgen comment)LONDON, Nov 18 (Reuters) - Amgen’s new injectable cholesterol drug Repatha has been turned down for use on Britain’s state health service, underscoring a worldwide debate about the value of such pricey medicines.Repatha belongs to a potent new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that are extremely effective at lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol.But the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cost watchdog said on Wednesday the question as to whether this would reduce heart attacks and strokes remained unanswered, given a lack of long-term clinical outcomes studies.NICE, which decides if treatments should be paid for on the National Health Service (NHS), also said in its draft guidance that analyses presented by Amgen had limitations that “called into question the reliability of the cost-effectiveness results”.Amgen said it was disappointed by the decision, since the evidence “strongly indicates that high cholesterol is linked to heart attacks and strokes”, and it aimed to provide more data and analyses to demonstrate the cost-effectiveness of Repatha.The British list price for Repatha is 4,448.60 pounds ($6,769) for a year’s treatment, which is less than half the U.S. list price of more than $14,000. NICE said Amgen had also offered the NHS a further undisclosed discount.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi have a rival product called Praluent that has not yet been assessed by NICE.The high price of PCSK9s has already stirred controversy in the United States, where Express Scripts, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers and health plans, recently reached discount deals for the medicines.

2015-11-20,Bumper haul of expensive new drugs heads to U.S. and Europe,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0T91WS20151120,"LONDON (Reuters) - Drug companies have brought a host of expensive new medicines to market in the United States and Europe this year, figures show, another bumper haul for an industry often accused of over-charging.Drug prices are set to be a major issue in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election next year, with Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton having pledged to rein in costs in a country that has the world’s highest prices.The busy drug pipeline to the West also illustrates how the vast bulk of research cash is spent on developing money-spinning medicines for rich countries, rather than to tackle tropical diseases that kill millions in the developing world.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has so far approved 38 novel drugs in 2015, more than the 34 that had been cleared by this stage a year ago and just short of 2014’s final total of 41, which was an 18-year high.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) is also waving through more products, recommending a total of 84 new medicines so far, up from 75 in the first 11 months of 2014, according to data released on Friday. Unlike the FDA, the EMA includes generic drugs in its list.The brisk pace of new arrivals over the past two years reflects improved productivity in drug research labs and a change of pace by regulators, who have committed to speed up the process of getting life-saving treatments to patients, especially in cancer.Over the past week, for example, AstraZeneca’s new lung cancer pill Tagrisso and Johnson & Johnson and Genmab multiple myeloma therapy Darzalex both won FDA approvals several months before the official decision deadline.And Takeda’s Ninlaro for multiple myeloma was added to the tally on Friday, also getting a green light earlier than scheduled.At the same time the drug industry’s hit rate for experimental products is improving, with the number of projects failing in the final stage of clinical testing falling markedly over the last six years.‘SCIENCE GOT BETTER’“The science has got better and we seem to be finding more molecules that are showing material improvements. The old idea that industry pipelines are thin is not really true anymore,” said Hilary Thomas, chief medical adviser at consultancy KPMG.“Regulators are also getting much slicker at approving breakthrough drugs and in some cases the decisions are even coming faster than the companies expected.”Significantly, the rapid pace of new drug launches is forecast to continue, with 225 new drugs expected to be approved between 2016 and 2020, according to a report from industry data firm IMS Health this week. IMS expects cancer treatments to be largest category.Drug companies argue they need to make decent profits to pay for the billions of dollars needed for drug research. Many companies also have extensive low-cost or even free access schemes for patients who cannot afford their medicines.But the high prices charged for modern drugs is generating increasing push-back from healthcare providers, patients and some doctors. The issue is highly charged in the United States, where for cancer drugs companies are charging up to 600 times what the medicines cost to make, according to an independent academic study published in September.Treatment options for rare diseases are also soaring and 30 percent of U.S. approvals so far this year have been for so-called orphan conditions, where annual costs often exceed $100,000 per patient.A new cystic fibrosis treatment called Orkambi from Vertex Pharmaceuticals, for example, was launched in July at $259,000 a year, prompting criticism from some U.S. doctors.Such premium prices are good news for companies and investors but a challenge for insurers and governments. The biggest problems, however, come not with rare diseases, where patient numbers are small, but with more common disorders.A price tag of more than $14,000 a year for two new cholesterol drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors sparked protests in the United States by healthcare providers. Some have now managed to get undisclosed discounts.Britain’s health cost agency this week also turned down the first such drug to be evaluated, even though the cost of the medicines is far lower in Europe.Amgen’s PCSK9 drug Repatha and Sanofi and Regeneron’s rival product Praluent are both expected to generate annual sales of around $2.5 billion by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis.Both drugs are designed for people who cannot get their cholesterol down sufficiently with standard statin pills, which are now available off-patent for pennies a day.Other medicines approved this year that are expected to be top-sellers include Novartis’s Entresto for heart failure, forecast to bring in an annual $5.4 billion by 2020, Pfizer’s breast cancer drug Ibrance, with anticipated 2020 sales of $5.3 billion, and Vertex’s Orkambi, on $4.5 billion.For healthcare systems in the developed world, paying for such pricey medicines is a challenge - but for many patients in poor countries they will remain out of reach, reflecting the economic realities of drug development.Just 1 percent of clinical trials under way worldwide are focused on neglected tropical diseases such as sleeping sickness, leishmaniasis and elephantiasis that maim, blind and kill millions.The cost burden in the industrialised world will be offset to some extent by patent expiries on older medicines, which opens the door to cheaper generics.The pharmaceutical industry argues this especially benefits the United States, given its high level of generic use, so that while Americans may pay more for drugs when they first come out, they pay less as products get older.IMS predicts generics will account for between 91 and 92 percent of all U.S. dispensed prescriptions by 2020, up from 88 percent at present. In Britain, generics currently account for just over three-quarters of prescriptions, while the level is lower in other parts of Europe."
2015-11-23,CVS chooses Amgen\'s new cholesterol drug over competitor,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N13I02R20151123,"NEW YORK, Nov 23 (Reuters) - U.S. drug benefit manager CVS Health said on Monday that it would add Amgen Inc.’s Repatha cholesterol treatment to its list of covered drugs for private plans over a competing treatment from Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.The two competing treatments, which can slash “bad” LDL cholesterol by more than 60 percent, were approved this summer by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and belong to a new class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors.Their pricetags have drawn criticism at a time when the national focus has turned to increases in costs of healthcare, and in particular, drugs for consumers. So far, use of the drugs has been held back by strict use policies set by pharmacy benefit managers.The FDA approved Repatha and Praluent, made by Regeneron and Sanofi, for patients with hereditary forms of high cholesterol and those with cardiovascular disease who require additional cholesterol lowering.Praluent costs $14,600 for a year of treatment and Amgen set an annual price of $14,100 for its Repatha. The companies were expected to offer rebates and discounts that would bring it down into the mid $12,000 range.These new cholesterol drugs are far more costly than generic statins, which are able to control cholesterol levels in most people.Drug benefit managers like CVS and Express Scripts have been closely watching use of these drugs, concerned about potential costs to the corporate employers and insurers who pay for their members’ drugs.CVS said that its pharmacy and therapeutics committee of external experts, including clinical pharmacists and physicians, evaluated the competing drugs and viewed them as therapeutically equivalent.“We have determined that choosing a single PCSK9 inhibitor for our commercial formularies allows us to get the best price possible for clients,” Dr. Troyen Brennan, Chief Medical Officer of CVS Health, said in a press release. “We anticipate that for most members with high cholesterol, statins will remain the standard of care.”Statins are used by millions of Americans who have high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol.The drugs are stronger than traditional cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. But it is not yet known whether their cholesterol-lowering power will translate into a reduced number of heart attacks.Express Scripts in October said it had struck a deal to cover both drugs and would not exclude one from its list of covered drugs, a tactic it does use with other competing treatments.

2015-12-21,Independent group says new Glaxo asthma drug far too expensive,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0U428J20151221,"(Reuters) - An independent nonprofit organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines found the price of GlaxoSmithKline’s new drug for severe asthma should be as much as 76 percent lower to justify its value, according to the group’s latest draft report.The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said its analysis indicated that Glaxo’s Nucala should be priced at $7,800 to about $12,000 a year, far below the drug’s list price of $32,500 a year.It found that once-monthly injectable Nucala, which won U.S. approval last month, significantly reduces asthma attacks and symptoms and decreases the need for oral steroids. However, it found that the price was not cost-effective, and that there is uncertainty about whether the benefits will persist over the long term because of the short duration of clinical trials.Glaxo, in an emailed statement, said it supports the work of ICER but disagrees with its conclusion. It said controlling severe asthma attacks helps reduce direct and indirect costs to the healthcare system, such as the need for urgent care visits and hospitalizations.“We believe that Nucala is fairly priced, balancing innovation and market value with patient access,” Glaxo spokeswoman Sarah Spencer said.In the same report, ICER found Novo Nordisk’s long-acting insulin Tresiba, which will compete with Sanofi’s big-selling Lantus, to be reasonably priced. It said the list price of $7,800 per year was about 8 to 10 percent too high, but that that was “well within the range of typical discounts available to payers.”The report found that Tresiba, which gained U.S. approval in September, provides moderate certainty of equivalent blood sugar control with a reduction in nocturnal hypoglycemia comparable to other long-acting insulins.ICER President Steven Pearson, in a statement, said its analyses aim “to help the health care community determine what should be used, which patients benefit most, and at what price innovative treatments represent a reasonable value.”ICER said the latest draft report will be open to public comment until Jan. 12.In a previous report, the group found that a potent new class of injectable cholesterol-lowering drugs, one being sold by Amgen and another by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in partnership with Sanofi, should cost about a third of their list prices to keep costs in line with healthcare budgets and the benefit they bring. Those drugs, Repatha and Praluent, list for more than $14,000 a year."

2015-2-17,CVS urges cost controls for new cholesterol drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0LL1CQ20150217,"(Reuters) - CVS Health warned on Tuesday that the costs of a potent new class of cholesterol treatments could eclipse those of other expensive medicines and overwhelm the U.S. healthcare system “if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place.”Two of the new injectable cholesterol treatments, called PCSK9 inhibitors, could gain U.S. approval this summer. CVS said they could eventually be used by as many as 15 million patients at an annual cost of up to $150 billion a year if priced at $7,000 to $12,000 a year, making it the highest-selling class of drugs in history.“The resilience and ability of our health care system to absorb such high costs will be tested if rigid cost control mechanisms are not put in place,” William Shrank, chief scientific officer for CVS, said in a statement.CVS, the second-largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM), negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through contracts with employers and health plans.The CVS call for cost controls follows sharp criticism from insurers, other payers and politicians over the high cost of new, highly effective treatments for hepatitis C, especially two medicines from Gilead Science Inc that have retail prices of up to $94,500 per patient for a course of treatment.Unlike those drugs, which are typically taken for about 12 weeks, the PCSK9s would be used for a lifetime.Express Scripts, the largest U.S. PBM, which has waged a campaign against Gilead’s hepatitis C drugs and is now scrutinizing costly cancer medications, provided a slightly different view of the new cholesterol drug market.Express Scripts also expects annual costs of around $10,000 per year per patient. But it sees a patient population that will start small before it ever reaches a possible high of 10 million people and a potential annual cost of $100 billion.Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview that limits set by regulators and the fact that the first wave of drugs are injections may slow their uptake.“We are going to work to get these products at the best price possible, but they also deserve to get value in the marketplace,” Miller said.Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting approval of rival PCSK9 inhibitors.They are expected to be used first by patients who are genetically prone to extreme high cholesterol - a population that CVS and Express peg at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used by those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor.Amgen declined to comment on the pricing issue and Regeneron did not respond to a request for comment.Shares of Amgen closed up 0.5 percent at $154.24, while Regeneron’s stock gained 0.4 percent to $404.18. Sanofi’s shares slipped 0.2 percent to 85.53 euros in trading in Paris."

By contrast, CVS warned that the new cholesterol drugs might be needed “for the duration of patients’ lives” and eventually be deemed appropriate for as many as 15 million Americans.Amgen Inc and a partnership of Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc are awaiting U.S. approval of their rival PCSK9 inhibitors. They are expected to be approved for patients who are genetically prone to high levels of cholesterol - a population that CVS pegs at 620,000 Americans. They also are likely to be used for those who cannot tolerate standard statin treatments, like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor.The experimental treatments, in combination with statins, knocked down their levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by as much as 60 percent more than statins alone.Gilead’s Harvoni, which combines Sovaldi with another of its anti-viral medicines into a daily pill, won U.S. approval late last year and has a retail price of $94,500. By itself, Sovaldi’s list price is $84,000 per treatment.Gilead has acknowledged negotiating price discounts with payers of more than 40 percent for the two hepatitis C brands, as it vies for market share with a newer rival therapy from AbbVie called Viekira Pak.Shares of Amgen were up 0.8 percent on Tuesday on the Nasdaq, while Regeneron’s stock gained 2.2 percent.

2015-2-18,CVS to limit cost of new cholesterol drugs through strict controls,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0LN02620150219,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp aims to control costs for a class of new cholesterol-fighting drugs by instituting strict prior authorization and other controls, according to the company, which negotiates drug prices for 65 million people through its pharmacy benefit manager unit.Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer at CVS, warned in a blog post this week that the new injectable cholesterol treatments, called PCSK9 inhibitors, could be prescribed for as many as 15 million Americans, at an annual cost of $7,000 to $12,000 per patient.CVS aims to limit initial utilization of the new drugs, which would be used for a lifetime. “We think the overall prevalence of therapy with this can be kept relatively low if there is appropriate utilization management put in place,” he told Reuters on Wednesday.He noted that such restrictions helped limit spending on Gilead Sciences Inc’s $1,000 hepatitis C pill after it was launched in late 2013.CVS, and other large payers like Express Scripts Holding Co, campaigned throughout 2014 against the high price of Gilead’s drug. Competition emerged late last year when regulators approved a new hepatitis C treatment from AbbVie Inc and Gilead recently acknowledged it is discounting its prices by nearly 50 percent to secure market share.Brennan expects a similar outcome for PCSK9 drugs. Amgen Inc and a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA have each filed for U.S. regulatory approval of rival PCSK9 inhibitors. Pfizer Inc is also developing a drug in the same class.“We expect there will be competition between various similar medications when they come out,” Brennan said.None of the PCSK9 drugs have been approved, and their usage labels are unknown, but Brennan said they will likely be approved for patients who are genetically prone to extreme high cholesterol and people whose cholesterol is not adequately controlled with statins, an older class of pills. He said approval is also being sought for use of PCSK9 inhibitors in a larger population of people who cannot tolerate statins.“We will require laboratory testing to assure that these are appropriate medications for the patient,” he said. Diagnostics would include genetic testing, measuring levels of LDL, or bad, cholesterol in the blood and testing people who cannot tolerate statins for muscle and liver enzymes to understand whether that intolerance is based on biochemical problems caused by existing medications.He said that, over time, if studies can demonstrate that the new drugs reduce the risk of cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke, usage could be widened."
2015-2-19,"Sanofi names CEO, cites \'capabililty to unite teams\'",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0LN2CZ20150219,"PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA on Thursday named Olivier Brandicourt, a Paris-educated doctor and head of Bayer AG's BAYGn.DE healthcare arm, as its chief executive officer.Brandicourt had been widely tipped to become Sanofi’s new boss, a position that opened when Chris Viehbacher was suddenly sacked last year.The 59-year-old Frenchman, who researched tropical and infectious diseases before joining the corporate pharmaceutical world, will take over as CEO on April 2, Sanofi said.“Olivier Brandicourt’s strong experience combined with his international profile, deep knowledge of U.S. and emerging healthcare markets, and his capability to unite teams will provide new dynamism to Sanofi’s strategy of diversification and innovation,” Sanofi Chairman Serge Weinberg said in a statement.Weinberg, caretaker CEO since Viehbacher’s ouster, told shocked investors in October by saying that Viehbacher had been a poor communicator with the board and must take responsibility for faltering U.S. sales of key diabetes drug Lantus.Weinberg said two weeks ago that a successor would be named by the end of March.Sanofi is France’s biggest listed company, employing 27,500 people in France, making up a third of the country’s pharmaceuticals jobs and a quarter of the company’s own worldwide workforce.One of Viehbacher’s mistakes was to develop a politically explosive plan to cut French jobs without telling the board.Brandicourt, a 28-year industry veteran who also previously held an executive position at Pfizer Inc PFE.N, spent his early adult life in France and should be attuned to national sensitivities.“He has the necessary criteria to do this job,” said Norbert Janisch, fund manager with Raiffeisen Capital Management in Vienna. “First of all, he is French and therefore well connected in France. And second, he knows the American market, which is important for a large pharmaceutical company.”Germany’s Bayer had recruited Brandicourt only 17 months ago from Pfizer.Bayer said that executive board member Werner Baumann will replace Brandicourt as healthcare division head, in addition to maintaining his responsibilities for group strategy, portfolio management and European markets.This will likely bolster his position as front runner to replace Bayer CEO Marijn Dekkers, who last year said he would step down at the end of 2016.Lantus, which accounts for over 30 percent of Sanofi’s profits, is due to lose U.S. patent protection this year.A replacement, Toujeo, is awaiting U.S. approval and is set for launch by June. It is arguably the most important of six Sanofi drug launches expected this year, including a potent new type of cholesterol fighter in partnership with U.S. biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. REGN.O. Brandicourt is also seen as the right man to boost Sanofi’s emerging markets portfolio, which represents a third of revenue.After earning his medical degree, Brandicourt spent eight years with the Paris Institute of Infectious and Tropical Diseases focused on malaria research in West and Central Africa and worked as a doctor in the Democratic Republic of Congo.Sanofi plans to launch a vaccine for dengue fever this year.Brandicourt also has takeover credentials that may prove useful at a time when companies pressured by generic drug competition are becoming either predators or prey.During Brandicort's brief Bayer tenure, the group bought Merck & Co Inc's MRK.N consumer care business for $14.2 billion and Norwegian cancer drug developer Algeta for $2.9 billion."
2015-2-27,Novartis treatment for vision loss meets goals in study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0W13W220150227,"ZURICH, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Swiss drugmaker Novartis said on Friday its treatment for a leading cause of age-related blindness had met its primary goals in a study and could potentially pave the way for less frequent dosing compared to a drug already on the market.Developed by Novartis’s eyecare unit Alcon, the RTH258 drug is intended to treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which causes severe loss of vision in the over 50s and occurs when the centre of the retina, or macula, deteriorates.Novartis said RTH258 demonstrated promising improvements in vision in the Phase II study that were as good as the popular treatment Eylea, produced by drugmakers Regeneron in the United States and Bayer elsewhere.Patients treated every three months with RTH258 experienced prolonged effects of the treatment, which could potentially reduce the treatment burden, Novartis said, adding Alcon had started a late-stage Phase III trial of the drug.Novartis already sells an older drug for AMD called Lucentis.

That’s the best way to describe the waiting today,” said Paul Schatz, president and chief investment officer at Heritage Capital in Woodbridge, Connecticut.The S&P and the Dow had hit records and the Nasdaq surpassed 5,000 at the start of the week after a strong February performance for U.S. stocks, giving additional reason for investors to take a breather on Thursday.European news was some help to U.S. markets but higher-than-expected U.S. jobless claims took “a little bit of the wind out of the sails,” said Paul Brigandi, managing director of portfolio management at Direxion Funds in New York.Initial jobless claims rose to 320,000 in the latest week, above the 295,000 estimate. The disappointing numbers came after a weaker-than-expected private payrolls report on Wednesday and ahead of Friday’s monthly employment report.A separate report showed new orders for U.S. factory goods unexpectedly fell in January for a sixth month, a sign of weakness in the manufacturing sector.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI rose 38.82 points, or 0.21 percent, to 18,135.72, the S&P 500 .SPX gained 2.51 points, or 0.12 percent, to 2,101.04 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC added 15.67 points, or 0.32 percent, to 4,982.81.Earlier in the day, the European Central Bank raised growth and inflation targets and announced it would start its government bond-buying program of 60 billion euros a month on March 9.AbbVie ABBV.N said it would buy Pharmacyclics PCYC.O for about $21 billion, giving it access to what is expected to be one of the world's top-selling cancer drugs. Pharmacyclics shares jumped 10.3 percent to $254.22 while AbbVie fell 5.7 percent to $56.86.The news also helped lift other healthcare stocks such as Vertex Pharmaceuticals VRTX.O, which closed up 5.8 percent at $126.96. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O added 3.8 percent to $428.95 and Biogen Idec BIIB.O rose 2.8 percent to $425.60.About 5.7 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, below the 6.5 billion average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by 1,660 to 1,371, for a 1.21-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,560 issues rose and 1,154 fell, for a 1.35-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 21 new 52-week highs and 2 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 97 new highs and 42 new lows."
2015-3-15,"Experimental cholesterol drugs cut heart risk, but questions remain",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0MB0PH20150315,"San Diego (Reuters) - Studies of a new class of experimental cholesterol-lowering drugs signal that they can reduce by half the risk of heart attack and other major cardiovascular problems compared to standard treatment alone.Doctors at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology, where the studies were presented, called the results “encouraging,” but said larger, controlled trials are needed to fully understand the drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors.An analysis of about 4,500 patients who stayed on treatment for nearly a year after completing earlier trials of Amgen Inc’s Repatha, also known as evolocumab, found that 0.95 percent of those given the drug and standard therapy suffered a cardiovascular event, compared with 2.18 percent of the group on standard treatment, which ranged from diet changes to drugs such as statins.Amgen defined “event” as death, heart attack, stroke or “mini-stroke,” unstable chest pain or heart failure requiring hospitalization, or the need for a procedure to restore bloodflow to the heart.Side effects more frequent, but still rare, in patients treated with Repatha included neurocognitive problems, such as confusion, something the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has said should be monitored closely.Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s head of cardiovascular and metabolic therapies, told Reuters that the company does not believe there is a safety issue.Neurocognitive side effects were also more common in the treatment arm of an 18-month, 2,300-patient trial of a rival PCSK9 drug being developed by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.The drug, Praluent, was shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular problems from 3.3 percent for placebo patients to 1.7 percent for the treatment group. “Events” in this trial were defined only as death, heart attack, stroke and chest pain requiring hospitalization.“Some of the endpoints in these trials are kind of soft, and they aren’t prospective studies,” said Dr. Anthony DeMaria, director of the cardiovascular center at the University of California San Diego who was not involved in the trials. “It’s encouraging that the larger trials are likely to succeed, but we still need those trials.”Dr Marc Sabatine, lead investigator of the Repatha study, said data for both drugs “are very consistent ... it appears that cutting LDL by 61 percent translates to a roughly 50 percent reduction in cardiovascular events.”Numerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower blood levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, but investors expect widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent death, heart attacks and other serious heart problems.The experimental drugs are antibodies, given by injection, designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. They work differently from statins - pills, now available as low-cost generics, that block the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.Both Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron have filed for FDA approval of their drugs, based on trials showing that they lower LDL in patients whose cholesterol is not controlled by other drugs, those who cannot tolerate other drugs and people genetically predisposed to high cholesterol.The FDA is slated to decide on Amgen’s application for Repatha by Aug. 27, while the regulatory deadline for Praluent, also known as alirocumab, is July 24.Health insurers are already bracing for the impact on drug spending. Express Scripts Holding Co, the largest manager of prescription drug plans for U.S. employers, projects an annual cost as high as $10,000 per patient for PCSK9 drugs, which it says could be used for 10 million Americans.Both Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron do not expect definitive data on cardiovascular outcomes for their drugs until larger trials conclude in 2017. Pfizer Inc,, which has not yet filed for regulatory approval of its PCSK9 drug, said it expects outcomes data in a similar time frame."

(bit.ly/1EClfJv)Bristol-Myers’ cancer medicine Opdivo tops the list, with projected 2019 sales of $5.7 billion, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Cortellis.Opdivo belongs to a new class of medicines called PD-1 inhibitors that work by blocking a mechanism tumours use to hide from the immune system, allowing it to recognise and attack cancer cells.The drug went on sale in Japan in September 2014 but was only approved for melanoma in the United States at the end of December, since when it has also received a green light for lung cancer, underlying the potential that healthcare authorities see in such so-called immunotherapies.Sanofi’s cholesterol drug Praluent, which is being developed with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is expected to generate annual sales in 2019 of $4.4 billion -- twice that seen for Amgen’s rival Repatha.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is due to decide this summer whether to approve the two drugs, which both tackle difficult-to-treat cases of high cholesterol by targeting a protein known as PCSK9.Novartis’ new first-in-class heart failure drug LCZ-696, meanwhile, is forecast to sell $3.7 billion by 2019, following impressive clinical trial results. The drug could win U.S. approval in August."
2015-3-23,"Pfizer, Lilly to resume study testing pain drug",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N0WP50T20150323,"(Adds details on FDA decision that allows resumed testing)March 23 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly and Co will resume late-stage studies of their drug tanezumab for chronic pain after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration lifted a partial hold on trials of it and similar medicines.Pfizer expects to receive a $200 million upfront payment from Lilly as a result of the development, the companies said on Monday.The FDA, in December 2012, restricted clinical studies of tanezumab and other pain drugs that work by blocking a protein called nerve growth factor (NGF), because of nervous-system side effects seen in animal studies conducted by other companies. But the agency allowed trials of the non-narcotic medicine against terminal cancer pain to continue.Pfizer and Lilly said they will now resume the chronic pain studies because the FDA, after reviewing positive nonclinical data on the nervous system responses to tanezumab, had lifted the partial hold.If tanezumab is approved, it could have sales of $100 million in 2020, Cowen and Co has forecast, which could grow further as the drug is approved for new pain conditions.Still, Tanezumab could face competition from anti-NGF drugs being developed by others, including a partnership of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi.Shares of Pfizer surged 2.9 percent to $35.23 in morning trading Monday. Eli Lilly was up 1.3 percent at $77.10.Pfizer and Lilly agreed in 2013 to jointly develop and sell tanezumab for several pain-related conditions, with the companies equally sharing development expenses and future sales.Tanezumab had shown initial promise in relieving pain in the knee and lower back, but Pfizer in 2010 suspended large late-stage trials of the drug for those conditions due to reports that patients’ osteoarthritis had worsened.The FDA, however, later recommended that the osteoarthritis trials continue if safeguards were put in place and patients did not simultaneously take other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.One of Pfizer’s biggest products is Celebrex, another pain and arthritis drug, which had global sales last year of $2.7 billion. But its sales are expected to plunge this year, following the drug’s loss of U.S. marketing exclusivity in December."

2015-3-27,"Ohr Pharma\'s eye drug fails mid-stage study, shares plunge",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0MN1AO20150327,"(Reuters) - Ohr Pharmaceutical Inc said its experimental eye drug failed the main goal in a mid-stage study as a combination therapy, wiping out two-thirds of the company’s market value on Friday.The study tested the eye-drop solution, OHR-102, in combination with Roche Holding AG’s injectable eye drug Lucentis, in patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the leading cause of blindness in the elderly.Ohr’s drug failed the study’s main goal of reducing the average number of Lucentis injections per patient when used in combination with the Roche drug.Wet AMD is characterized by the growth of new blood vessels under the retina and macula, a process known as choroidal neovascularization (CNV) that leads to a rapid deterioration in vision.There are two forms of CNV, “classic” and “occult”. The more severe “classic” version affects about two-thirds of wet-AMD sufferers.Although a combination of OHR-102 and Lucentis improved visual clarity in about 42 percent of classic CNV patients, compared with 28 percent in the Lucentis monotherapy group, less of a benefit was seen in the overall population, the company said.“There’s no sugar coating it, the fact that the study didn’t reach statistical significance ... in the overall patient population ... is disappointing to say the least,” Cowen & Co analyst Tyler Van Buren said, cutting his price target on Ohr to $15 from $25.Ohr now hopes to initiate a late-stage study in patients with classic CNV by the second half of 2015, delaying OHR-102’s development by about three to six months, the company said in a conference call.Buren expects OHR-102 to hit the U.S. market in 2019, and estimates peak sales of $1 billion.The news of OHR-102’s failure sent Ophthotech Corp’s stock up about 5 percent on Friday. Ophthotech’s eye injection, Fovista, is undergoing late-stage testing in combination with Lucentis for wet-AMD.Both Ohr and Ophthotech’s drugs target a protein called platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), which regulates cell growth and division.OHR-102, however, is a solution that can be self-administered, while Fovista, like Lucentis and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s blockbuster drug Eylea, must be injected into the eye.Shares of Ohr, which has two other drugs in development, were down about 64 percent at $3.06."

To receive The Day Ahead, Eikon users can register at . Thomson One users can register at RT/DAY/US. All times in ET/GMT)The market is undergoing something of a shift as bond yields rise and the dollar’s strength abates in response to the unexpectedly strong data out of Germany that suggests a small pickup in the economy and a renewed expectation for modest inflation. This is in contrast to a few months ago, when deflation was the expected condition for months to come. The dollar’s slump should peter out at some point, given the advantage of U.S. yields, but yields may need to back up further, particularly if U.S. economic figures are strong enough to warrant a more hawkish outlook for the Fed.

2015-5-07,Regeneron expects Eylea sales to grow faster than expected,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N0XY4FS20150507,"(Adds comment from conference call, share movement)May 7 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said it expects sales of blockbuster eye drug Eylea to grow even more quickly following data that showed it was superior to rival treatments.The company said it now expected net sales of its flagship drug to be 30-35 percent higher this year than in 2014, when Eylea raked in global sales of $2.78 billion.In February, the company forecast sales growth of 25-30 percent.Sales of Eylea in the United States leapt 51 percent to $541 million in the first quarter ended March 31, helping the company’s adjusted profit handsomely beat the average analyst estimate.Eylea has charmed investors since it was first approved in late 2011 to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly.Regeneron’s shares have risen nearly eight-fold since the drug’s launch, while revenue has soared to more than $2.8 billion from about $446 million.The stock climbed as much as 3 percent to $482.99 on the Nasdaq on Thursday, before paring those gains to trade slightly down.Data from a government-sponsored study, called “Protocol-T”, published in February demonstrated that Eylea was better than Roche Holding AG’s rival drugs, Avastin and Lucentis, particularly in patients with severe vision loss.Much of Eylea’s growth appears to be related to the reaction among physicians to the protocol-T data, said Robert Terifay, Regeneron’s senior vice president, commercial.“According to our qualitative survey, the market share for Eylea now surpasses Lucentis in the United States,” Terifay said on a post-earnings call.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in March expanded the use of Eylea to treat diabetic retinopathy, the most common diabetic eye disease and a leading cause of blindness in adults.Eylea has also been cleared to fight macular edema, and a related sight-robbing condition called diabetic macular edema.Even as Eylea sales continue unabated, investors are turning their focus to the company’s next potential blockbuster Praluent, which is aimed at millions who cannot tolerate or realize enough benefit from widely-used statins.The companies are in a fierce race with Amgen Inc, which is also looking to market a similar drug.Regeneron anticipates an initial “gradual” uptake of Praluent, executives said on the call, citing a “complex and carefully managed” reimbursement environment.

2015-5-13,RPT-INSIGHT-How DNA sequencing is transforming the hunt for new drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0Y338720150513,"(Repeating story to additional subscribers without changes to text)CHICAGO, May 13 (Reuters) - Drug manufacturers have begun amassing enormous troves of human DNA in hopes of significantly shortening the time it takes to identify new drug candidates, a move some say is transforming the development of medicines.The efforts will help researchers identify rare genetic mutations by scanning large databases of volunteers who agree to have their DNA sequenced and to provide access to detailed medical records.It is made possible by the dramatically lower cost of genetic sequencing - it took government-funded scientists $3 billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003. As of last year, the cost was closer to $1,500 per genome, down from $20,000 five years ago.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which signed a deal with Pennsylvania’s Geisinger Health System in January 2014 to sequence partial genomes of some 250,000 volunteers, is already claiming discoveries based on the new approach. Company executives told Reuters they have used data from the first 35,000 volunteers to confirm the promise of 250 genes on a list of targets for drugs aimed at common medical conditions, including high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.Regeneron says it has also identified “several dozen” new gene targets, including a novel gene that plays a role in obesity.Pfizer Inc, Roche Holding AG and Biogen Inc are working on similar projects that use DNA and patient health data to find new drug targets or predict the effects of drugs.Their investments have been inspired by early successes in cancer with drugs such as Pfizer’s lung cancer treatment Xalkori, which was approved in 2011 and targets mutations in tumors driving the disease. More recently, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has changed the treatment of cystic fibrosis with Kalydeco, which targets the disease’s underlying genetic cause.“All of a sudden, it all opened up,” as companies recognize the potential for drugs targeting genetic glitches, Dr. Eric Topol, a genomics expert at the Scripps Translational Science Institute. “It’s starting to really become a new preferred model for drug development.”In the past, discovering such genes was a painstaking process, often involving years of research into isolated populations. In 1991, for example, researchers discovered a rare mutation in a gene called Angptl3 that caused very low levels of artery-clogging cholesterol and triglycerides among families in the remote Italian village of Campodimele.It took nearly two more decades and several groups of scientists to fully understand the potential cardiovascular benefits linked to mutations in that gene.Since last autumn, the Regeneron Genetics Center has sequenced the DNA of more than 35,000 Geisinger patients and is on track to sequence 100,000 by year end. Already, the company has identified 100 people carrying similar cholesterol-affecting mutations to those first observed in Campodimele and elsewhere.“You no longer have to find that one rare family in Italy, because it’s just in the database,” said Dr. George Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer of Regeneron.Identifying target genes is just a first step, though, and does not guarantee that a drug can be developed on a genetic lead, or that it will ultimately be safe and effective enough to be used.Experts also differ on approach. Regeneron is sequencing exomes, the protein-making genes that comprise 1 to 2 percent of the genome, a search that costs roughly $700 per person. Others favor looking at the whole genome, which costs the $1,500 per person.Craig Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome, believes the whole genome approach will be more meaningful over time.“I’d rather have a gold mine with a deep vein of gold and modern industrial equipment to mine it rather than sitting there with a pan in a stream looking for gold,” he said. “Both will find gold. It’s a question of how much you find.”Even so, the early returns from new “genomic” medicines have attracted attention from the White House. In January, President Barack Obama said he would seek $130 million from Congress to gather genetic data from 1 million volunteers as part of a “precision medicine” initiative.Regeneron is lobbying for the Geisinger database to become a cornerstone of that effort, and proposes creating a consortium of drugmakers to fund it. In return, Yancopoulos said, the company hopes to recoup some of its investment.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which is in charge of the precision medicine project, identified Regeneron among a short list of potential contributors to the 1 million-strong DNA study. Others on the list include Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic, and the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin. A decision is expected by early fall.For drug companies, the lure of a big payoff is strong. Regeneron and its partner Sanofi are expected to soon win regulatory approval for a cholesterol-lowering drug that works by blocking the PCSK9 gene. Amgen and Pfizer have developed similar treatments.Individuals born with non-functioning versions of PCSK9 have very low cholesterol. The new drugs mimic that effect and are considered a poster child for treatments that take advantage of glitches in the genome that prove beneficial to the rare individuals who carry them. Wall Street analysts project Regeneron/Sanofi’s PCSK9 drug will generate revenues of $4.4 billion by 2019.Amgen bolstered its search for gene targets by buying Decode Genetics in late 2012 for $415 million, giving it a database of complete genetic sequences of 2,636 Icelanders. The community shares a relatively homogenous genetic profile due to its geographic isolation, allowing researchers to identify gene variations more easily.In March, Amgen reported the discovery of a new mutation that increases the risk of Alzheimer’s and confirmed the role of two mutations involved in diabetes and atrial fibrillation.This past January, Roche’s Genentech unit tapped Venter’s Human Longevity Inc for a large sequencing project.Genetic testing company 23andMe announced deals this year with Genentech and Pfizer. Genentech will have access to 3,000 individuals in 23andMe’s community of Parkinson’s patients, and Pfizer will expand an existing collaboration with the company to study the genetics of lupus.That same month, Biogen formed a $30 million research alliance to support the formation of a sequencing center at Columbia University.“All of the companies are feeling like, ‘Oh my gosh. We have to do something substantial in genomics - yesterday,’” said Dr. David Goldstein, director of Columbia’s Institute for Genomic Medicine.At the heart of Regeneron’s model is finding rare mutations that disable normal gene function. So far, it has identified people with at least one such “loss-of-function” gene that correlates with nearly all 250 genes on the company’s list of drug targets.That includes essentially every gene previously linked to triglyceride regulation and several novel candidates, Yancopoulos said. They have done the same for cholesterol and coronary artery disease.Regeneron has also partnered with academic centers studying families with extreme genetic disorders, collaborations that already have led to the discovery of a couple of dozen new candidate genes, said Dr. Aris Baras, who runs Regeneron’s genetics center.In one case, they are using the Geisinger database to study a rare gene they believe causes severe obesity in young children. The team has found milder mutations in the overall population that may cause an average 10-pound weight gain in adults. That would validate the role that such genes play in regulating body weight and suggests that, “if you had a drug it could have a profound effect,” Yancopoulos said.“This is why everybody is excited about it,” he said.

Company executives told Reuters they have used data from the first 35,000 volunteers to confirm the promise of 250 genes on a list of targets for drugs aimed at common medical conditions, including high levels of cholesterol and triglycerides.Regeneron says it has also identified “several dozen” new gene targets, including a novel gene that plays a role in obesity.Pfizer Inc, Roche Holding AG and Biogen Inc are working on similar projects that use DNA and patient health data to find new drug targets or predict the effects of drugs.Their investments have been inspired by early successes in cancer with drugs such as Pfizer’s lung cancer treatment Xalkori, which was approved in 2011 and targets mutations in tumors driving the disease. More recently, Vertex Pharmaceuticals has changed the treatment of cystic fibrosis with Kalydeco, which targets the disease’s underlying genetic cause.“All of a sudden, it all opened up,” as companies recognize the potential for drugs targeting genetic glitches, Dr. Eric Topol, a genomics expert at the Scripps Translational Science Institute. “It’s starting to really become a new preferred model for drug development.”In the past, discovering such genes was a painstaking process, often involving years of research into isolated populations. In 1991, for example, researchers discovered a rare mutation in a gene called Angptl3 that caused very low levels of artery-clogging cholesterol and triglycerides among families in the remote Italian village of Campodimele.It took nearly two more decades and several groups of scientists to fully understand the potential cardiovascular benefits linked to mutations in that gene.Since last autumn, the Regeneron Genetics Center has sequenced the DNA of more than 35,000 Geisinger patients and is on track to sequence 100,000 by year end. Already, the company has identified 100 people carrying similar cholesterol-affecting mutations to those first observed in Campodimele and elsewhere.“You no longer have to find that one rare family in Italy, because it’s just in the database,” said Dr. George Yancopoulos, chief scientific officer of Regeneron.Identifying target genes is just a first step, though, and does not guarantee that a drug can be developed on a genetic lead, or that it will ultimately be safe and effective enough to be used.Experts also differ on approach. Regeneron is sequencing exomes, the protein-making genes that comprise 1 to 2 percent of the genome, a search that costs roughly $700 per person. Others favor looking at the whole genome, which costs the $1,500 per person.Craig Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome, believes the whole genome approach will be more meaningful over time.“I’d rather have a gold mine with a deep vein of gold and modern industrial equipment to mine it rather than sitting there with a pan in a stream looking for gold,” he said. “Both will find gold. It’s a question of how much you find.”Even so, the early returns from new “genomic” medicines have attracted attention from the White House. In January, President Barack Obama said he would seek $130 million from Congress to gather genetic data from 1 million volunteers as part of a “precision medicine” initiative.Regeneron is lobbying for the Geisinger database to become a cornerstone of that effort, and proposes creating a consortium of drugmakers to fund it. In return, Yancopoulos said, the company hopes to recoup some of its investment.Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, which is in charge of the precision medicine project, identified Regeneron among a short list of potential contributors to the 1 million-strong DNA study. Others on the list include Kaiser Permanente, Mayo Clinic, and the Marshfield Clinic in Wisconsin. A decision is expected by early fall.For drug companies, the lure of a big payoff is strong. Regeneron and its partner Sanofi are expected to soon win regulatory approval for a cholesterol-lowering drug that works by blocking the PCSK9 gene. Amgen and Pfizer have developed similar treatments.Individuals born with non-functioning versions of PCSK9 have very low cholesterol. The new drugs mimic that effect and are considered a poster child for treatments that take advantage of glitches in the genome that prove beneficial to the rare individuals who carry them. Wall Street analysts project Regeneron/Sanofi’s PCSK9 drug will generate revenues of $4.4 billion by 2019.Amgen bolstered its search for gene targets by buying Decode Genetics in late 2012 for $415 million, giving it a database of complete genetic sequences of 2,636 Icelanders. The community shares a relatively homogenous genetic profile due to its geographic isolation, allowing researchers to identify gene variations more easily.In March, Amgen reported the discovery of a new mutation that increases the risk of Alzheimer’s and confirmed the role of two mutations involved in diabetes and atrial fibrillation.This past January, Roche’s Genentech unit tapped Venter’s Human Longevity Inc for a large sequencing project.Genetic testing company 23andMe announced deals this year with Genentech and Pfizer. Genentech will have access to 3,000 individuals in 23andMe’s community of Parkinson’s patients, and Pfizer will expand an existing collaboration with the company to study the genetics of lupus.That same month, Biogen formed a $30 million research alliance to support the formation of a sequencing center at Columbia University.“All of the companies are feeling like, ‘Oh my gosh. We have to do something substantial in genomics – yesterday,’” said Dr. David Goldstein, director of Columbia’s Institute for Genomic Medicine.At the heart of Regeneron’s model is finding rare mutations that disable normal gene function. So far, it has identified people with at least one such “loss-of-function” gene that correlates with nearly all 250 genes on the company’s list of drug targets.That includes essentially every gene previously linked to triglyceride regulation and several novel candidates, Yancopoulos said. They have done the same for cholesterol and coronary artery disease.Regeneron has also partnered with academic centers studying families with extreme genetic disorders, collaborations that already have led to the discovery of a couple of dozen new candidate genes, said Dr. Aris Baras, who runs Regeneron’s genetics center.In one case, they are using the Geisinger database to study a rare gene they believe causes severe obesity in young children. The team has found milder mutations in the overall population that may cause an average 10-pound weight gain in adults. That would validate the role that such genes play in regulating body weight and suggests that, “if you had a drug it could have a profound effect,” Yancopoulos said.“This is why everybody is excited about it,” he said."

2015-5-19,Amgen cholesterol drug could get EU green light this week,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N0YA47Z20150519,"LONDON, May 19 (Reuters) - Amgen’s new cholesterol drug Repatha could be recommended for approval in Europe as early as this week, putting it ahead in a race with a rival product from Sanofi.Repatha, or evolocumab, belongs to a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that clinical trials suggest may slash the risks of heart attacks compared to standard treatment alone.According to an agenda posted on the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) website on Tuesday, a committee of experts will consider whether to recommend the medicine at a four-day meeting concluding on May 21. (here)The fact Repatha is being discussed this week does not automatically mean a decision will be taken, since experts may decide they have further questions.The EMA is likely to communicate its decision on this and other new drugs around 1100 GMT on May 22. Recommendations for marketing approval by its Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) are normally endorsed by the European Commission within a couple of months.Amgen’s Repatha is in a race to market with Praluent, which is being developed by Sanofi and its partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.Numerous trials have shown that PCSK9 inhibitors significantly lower blood levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, but widespread use will hinge on whether the drugs are proven to prevent death, heart attacks and other serious heart problems.The experimental drugs are antibodies designed to target the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream. They work differently from statins, which block the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol in the first place.Both Amgen and Sanofi have filed for approval of their drugs based on trials showing that they lower LDL in patients whose cholesterol is not controlled by other drugs, those who cannot tolerate other drugs and people genetically predisposed to high cholesterol.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is slated to decide on Amgen’s application for Repatha by Aug. 27, while the deadline for Praluent, also known as alirocumab, is July 24.Neither Amgen nor Sanofi expect definitive data on cardiovascular outcomes for their drugs until larger trials conclude in 2017.Pfizer, which has not yet filed for approval of its PCSK9 drug, expects outcomes data in a similar time frame.

But there is at least one significant difference between the two offerings: the dosages in which they will be sold.Assuming approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Amgen Inc. will offer its drug, Repatha, as a biweekly 140 mg injection or a monthly injection of 420 mg, while Praluent, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi, will be offered in biweekly injections of 75 mg or 150 mg.The difference in dosages is likely to lead to very different sales strategies for the two drugs, in what could be a fierce competition for market share. Amgen’s high-dose monthly injection could be seen as more convenient and might appeal to doctors because of its higher potency. Regeneron and Sanofi could enjoy a significant pricing advantage with their low-dose option.Both drugs belong to a new class of antibodies that target PCSK9, a protein that maintains “bad” LDL cholesterol in the blood, and are aimed at the millions of people who don’t benefit from statins. Statin pills, like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, work very differently, blocking the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol.Neither Amgen nor Regeneron/Sanofi would talk about possible pricing of their new drugs, but some industry experts suggest that low-dose Praluent will be priced significantly below Repatha to make it more attractive to health insurers who have become increasingly aggressive about keeping medication costs down.Dr Jennifer Robinson, a University of Iowa epidemiologist and lead researcher on clinical trials of Praluent, believes Sanofi and Regeneron “would be crazy not to” price its 75 mg dose below the 150 mg option.“Sanofi will say you can start off at this cheaper, lower dose,” Robinson said. “If you don’t reach the LDL goal, you can move up” to a higher dose, at the higher price.Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges predicts that lower-dose Praluent will cost $5,000 a year, with the higher dose at $10,000. He estimates Repatha’s price at $10,000 per year for both the biweekly and monthly versions. Manufacturers do not necessarily charge less for lower doses of a medication.Amgen’s high-dose injections could be appealing in light of recent clinical data that has shown that keeping LDL very low can better protect against heart attack and stroke in high risk patients. Trial data has shown that both drugs produce greater LDL reductions in higher doses.“It goes back to the patients we are trying to serve - patients with elevated, very high LDL cholesterol,” said Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s head of cardiovascular and metabolic therapies. “We didn’t feel that a low dose option would serve those patients.”The FDA is due to decide on approval for Praluent by July 24 and on Repatha by Aug. 27. The agency, which has convened expert panels on June 9 and 10 to review both drugs, could also issue a joint decision.The two PCSK9 drugs are each expected to generate about $2.5 billion in annual sales by 2020, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis. Some predict total sales for the class rising to $20 billion by 2026.In March, new clinical trial data showed that both Repatha and Praluent, combined with statins, reduced LDL levels dramatically, cutting in half the risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major cardiovascular problems. Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen are conducting larger trials to confirm the benefits of PCSK9 drugs in reducing cardiovascular risks.Industry experts note that there are many unanswered questions about the market for the drugs, including how widely the FDA will allow them to be used, how aggressively cardiologists will seek to lower LDL and whether other differences between them will emerge from the larger trials that will yield results in 2017.Some see Sanofi having an advantage purely due to its larger marketing force among heart doctors.

But there is at least one significant difference between the two offerings: the dosages in which they will be sold.Assuming approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Amgen Inc. will offer its drug, Repatha, as a biweekly 140 mg injection or a monthly injection of 420 mg, while Praluent, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi, will be offered in biweekly injections of 75 mg or 150 mg.The difference in dosages is likely to lead to very different sales strategies for the two drugs, in what could be a fierce competition for market share. Amgen’s high-dose monthly injection could be seen as more convenient and might appeal to doctors because of its higher potency. Regeneron and Sanofi could enjoy a significant pricing advantage with their low-dose option.Both drugs belong to a new class of antibodies that target PCSK9, a protein that maintains “bad” LDL cholesterol in the blood, and are aimed at the millions of people who don’t benefit from statins. Statin pills, like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, work very differently, blocking the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol.Neither Amgen nor Regeneron/Sanofi would talk about possible pricing of their new drugs, but some industry experts suggest that low-dose Praluent will be priced significantly below Repatha to make it more attractive to health insurers who have become increasingly aggressive about keeping medication costs down.Dr Jennifer Robinson, a University of Iowa epidemiologist and lead researcher on clinical trials of Praluent, believes Sanofi and Regeneron “would be crazy not to” price its 75 mg dose below the 150 mg option.“Sanofi will say you can start off at this cheaper, lower dose,” Robinson said. “If you don’t reach the LDL goal, you can move up” to a higher dose, at the higher price.Sanford Bernstein analyst Geoffrey Porges predicts that lower-dose Praluent will cost $5,000 a year, with the higher dose at $10,000. He estimates Repatha’s price at $10,000 per year for both the biweekly and monthly versions. Manufacturers do not necessarily charge less for lower doses of a medication.Amgen’s high-dose injections could be appealing in light of recent clinical data that has shown that keeping LDL very low can better protect against heart attack and stroke in high risk patients. Trial data has shown that both drugs produce greater LDL reductions in higher doses.“It goes back to the patients we are trying to serve - patients with elevated, very high LDL cholesterol,” said Scott Wasserman, Amgen’s head of cardiovascular and metabolic therapies. “We didn’t feel that a low dose option would serve those patients.”The FDA is due to decide on approval for Praluent by July 24 and on Repatha by Aug. 27. The agency, which has convened expert panels on June 9 and 10 to review both drugs, could also issue a joint decision.The two PCSK9 drugs are each expected to generate about $2.5 billion in annual sales by 2020, according to Wall Street estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis. Some predict total sales for the class rising to $20 billion by 2026.In March, new clinical trial data showed that both Repatha and Praluent, combined with statins, reduced LDL levels dramatically, cutting in half the risk for heart attack, stroke, and other major cardiovascular problems. Sanofi/Regeneron and Amgen are conducting larger trials to confirm the benefits of PCSK9 drugs in reducing cardiovascular risks.Industry experts note that there are many unanswered questions about the market for the drugs, including how widely the FDA will allow them to be used, how aggressively cardiologists will seek to lower LDL and whether other differences between them will emerge from the larger trials that will yield results in 2017.Some see Sanofi having an advantage purely due to its larger marketing force among heart doctors. Another possible factor in which drug will dominate the market is the success or failure of a lawsuit Amgen has brought against Sanofi and Regeneron for alleged patent infringement.But in the meantime, with the main merits of the two drugs appearing nearly equal, their comparative dose and price will become much more important differentiators.Health insurers “are likely to view this as a class, one is the same as the other,” said Les Funtleyder healthcare portfolio manager for ESquared Asset Management, which does not own shares in any of the three drugmakers. “You could have a case where if payers pay, they’ll only pay for one rather than the other.”Express Scripts Holding Co is the largest U.S. manager of pharmacy benefit plans and successfully pressed for price reductions on novel hepatitis C drugs earlier this year.Its chief medical officer, Dr. Steve Miller, said in an interview that $10,000 per year for a new cholesterol drug is “an extraordinarily high price.” As many as 15 million Americans are estimated to have high cholesterol that cannot be controlled by statins.“We are bullish on the health benefits, but they have to bring value,” Miller said, adding that pricing would be a major factor in recommending either Praluent or Repatha for coverage.Dr Steven Nissen, chairman of the department of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic, said he is most concerned about effectiveness: “What counts is how much you can lower LDL cholesterol,” he said.But he acknowledges that if the lower dose also had a lower price, “there might be some people who find that appealing,” Nissen said.

2015-6-05,US STOCKS-Strong jobs report gives Wall St 2nd straight losing week,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0YR20R20150605,"* Indexes down for the week* May payrolls increase by 280,000 vs est 225,000* Wall St banks say September rate hike more likely* Indexes: Dow down 0.3 pct, S&P down 0.1 pct, Nasdaq up 0.2 pct (Updates to close)By Caroline ValetkevitchJune 5 (Reuters) - The Dow and S&P 500 eased on Friday as increasing expectations the Federal Reserve could raise rates as soon as September offset optimism over a recovery in the U.S. labor market.Stronger-than-expected jobs data for May and a pickup in wages were the latest signs of better momentum in the economy.Wall Street’s top banks said they expect the Fed to begin raising interest rates in September, followed by another increase before the end of the year, according to a Reuters poll.“The market is excited about stronger jobs and higher wages, but before (investors) can pop the cork of the champagne bottle, they start thinking about the hangover, which is higher interest rates,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in Chicago.“I think everyone is just waiting to see what happens when rates do start to rise.”The S&P utilities index, which includes top dividend payers that tend to fall as prospects for higher rates rise, was down 1.3 percent and among the weakest-performing sectors. The U.S. benchmark bond yield hit its highest since October.S&P financials, which benefit from higher rates, were up 0.6 percent, among the day’s best performing sectors, while the S&P energy index added 0.7 percent. Energy shares bounced with oil prices.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 56.12 points, or 0.31 percent, to 17,849.46, the S&P 500 lost 3.01 points, or 0.14 percent, to 2,092.83 and the Nasdaq Composite added 9.33 points, or 0.18 percent, to 5,068.46.For the week, the S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent, its second straight week of losses, the Dow was down 0.9 percent and the Nasdaq was down 0.03 percent.The Fed has kept overnight rates near zero since December 2008 because the economic recovery has been slow. Cheap credit, however, has helped bolster the U.S. stock market.New York Fed President William Dudley said he was concerned the economy may not be growing fast enough to absorb the slack among workers sidelined by the financial crisis. Still, Dudley said he expects the Fed would be in a position to raise rates later this year.Boosting the Nasdaq, shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc rose 4 percent to $539.40 after a preliminary FDA review of an experimental drug it makes with Sanofi SA .Among decliners on Friday were gold miners, which dropped along with gold prices. Shares of Newmont Mining were down 3.3 percent at $25.91.Zumiez dropped 19.3 percent to $24 as it estimated current-quarter profit and revenue below analysts’ expectations.NYSE decliners outnumbered advancers 1,629 to 1,426, for a 1.14-to-1 ratio; on the Nasdaq, 1,782 issues rose and 962 fell, for a 1.85-to-1 ratio favoring advancers.The S&P 500 posted 16 new 52-week highs and six new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 117 new highs and 42 new lows.About 6.2 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, slightly below the 6.3 billion daily average for the last five sessions, according to BATS Global Markets.

2015-6-05,"FDA staff: Sanofi\\/Regeneron drug lowers LDL, is well tolerated",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N0YR0JU20150605,"(Updates with analyst comment)WASHINGTON, June 5 (Reuters) - An experimental drug made by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc effectively lowers bad LDL cholesterol and is generally well tolerated, according to a preliminary review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.The review was published on the FDA’s website on Friday ahead of a meeting next Tuesday of a panel of outside advisers who will discuss the drug and recommend whether it should be approved. The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.The drug, Praluent, also known as alirocumab, is one of a new class of LDL-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. The committee on Wednesday will discuss another drug in the class, Amgen Inc’s Repatha.If approved, the drugs are expected to generate annual sales of more than $2.5 billion each by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data. Some analysts predict sales for the class rising to $20 billion by 2026.The panel is being asked by the FDA to consider which patient sub-populations with high cholesterol would best be served by Praluent - for example, those with different degrees of cardiovascular risk, patients with family histories of high cholesterol and high triglycerides, or patients who are or are not also taking statins, another type of cholesterol drug.The ability of a drug to lower LDL has been used by the FDA for two decades as a surrogate for its success in reducing the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular events.Several statin trials have shown cardiovascular benefits but not all LDL-lowering drugs have. Next week’s panel will be the first in many years to discuss the use of LDL as a surrogate measure for a new class of cholesterol drugs, the FDA said.The FDA said it will not require a cardiovascular outcomes trial as a condition of approval of Praluent, though the companies are conducting them. Amgen said on Friday it just completed enrollment in a 27,500 patient outcomes trial of Repatha in combination with statin therapy.“I think the committee and the FDA will be clearly grappling with issues related to which population do you use the drug in,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, head of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “What the FDA is doing is providing early access to these medications prior to the completion of the outcomes trials, but they don’t want them used in everyone until we see the outcomes data.”In an introductory memo to panel participants, Dr. James Smith, deputy director of the FDA’s division of metabolism and endocrinology products, said some patients will not take statins for a variety of reasons, even they can tolerate them with no side effects.“Thus, one must consider whether labeling that specifically indicates a drug for ‘statin-intolerant patients’ could promote a condition that is not well-understood and encourage some patients to prematurely abandon statins, a class that has robustly established benefits on CV outcomes.”A possible alternative, he said, would indicate the drug for use in combination with maximally tolerated statin therapy, recognizing that for some patients, maximally tolerated statin therapy may be no statin therapy at all.Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink, viewed the FDA’s review as “bullish.” He said it suggests the likelihood of a broad approval.Praluent is designed to be given in biweekly injections of 75 mg or 150 mg. Repatha is designed as a biweekly 140 mg injection or a monthly injection of 420 mg.The FDA is due to decide on approval for Praluent by July 24 and on Repatha by Aug. 27."

The human genome is the full complement of DNA, or genetic material, a copy of which is found in nearly every cell of the body.Clients view Google and Amazon as doing a better job storing genomics data than they can do using their own computers, keeping it secure, controlling costs and allowing it to be easily shared.The cloud companies are going beyond storage to offer analytical functions that let scientists make sense of DNA data. Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines are also competing for a slice of the market. The “cloud” refers to data or software that physically resides in a server and is accessible via the internet, which allows users to access it without downloading it to their own computer.Now an estimated $100 million to $300 million business globally, the cloud genomics market is expected to grow to $1 billion by 2018, said research analyst Daniel Ives of investment bank FBR Capital. By that time, the entire cloud market should have $50 billion to $75 billion in annual revenue, up from about $30 billion now.“The cloud is the entire future of this field,” Craig Venter, who led a private effort to sequence the human genome in the 1990s, said in an interview. His new company, San Diego-based Human Longevity Inc, recently tried to import genomic data from servers at the J. Craig Venter Institute in Rockville, Maryland.The transmission was so slow, scientists had to resort to sending disks and thumb drives by FedEx and human messengers, or “sneakernet,” he said. The company now uses Amazon Web Services.So does a collaboration between Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Pennsylvania-based Geisinger Health Systems to sequence 250,000 genomes. Raw DNA data is uploaded to Amazon’s cloud, where software from privately-held DNAnexus assembles the millions of chunks into the full, 3-billion-letter long genome.DNAnexus's algorithms then determine where an individual genome differs from the ""reference"" human genome, the company's chief scientist Dr. David Shaywitz said, in hopes of identifying new drug targets. >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> HEALTH-GENOMICS-CLOUD: How pharmaceutical researchers use Amazon web services to store and analyze DNA sequences. link.reuters.com/kan84w >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>Showing how important Google and Amazon view this business, and how they hope to use existing customers to lure future ones, each is hosting well-known genomics datasets for free.Neither company discloses the amount of genomics data it holds, but based on interviews with analysts and genomic scientists, as well as the companies’ own announcements of what customers they’ve won, Amazon Web Services may be bigger.Data from the “1000 Genomes Project,” an international public-private effort that identified genetic variations found in at least 1 percent of humans, reside at both Amazon and Google “without charge,” said Kathy Cravedi of the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH), one of the project’s sponsors.Other paying clients with a more specific focus are picking sides.Google, for instance, won a project from the Autism Speaks foundation to collect and analyze the genomes of 10,000 affected children and their parents for clues to the genetic basis of autism.Another customer is Tute Genomics, whose database of 8.5 billion human DNA variants can be searched for how frequently any given variant appears, what traits it’s associated with and how people with a certain variant respond to particular drugs.Amazon is hosting the Multiple Myeloma Foundation’s project to collect complete-genome sequences and other data from 1,000 patients to identify new drug targets. It also won the Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project, which has similar aims.Amazon charges about $4 to $5 a month to store one full human genome, and Google about $3 to $5 a month. The companies also charge for data transfers or computing time, as when scientists run analytical software on stored data.Amazon’s database-analysis tool, Redshift, costs 25 cents an hour or $1,000 per terabyte per year, the company said. A terabyte is 1 trillion bytes, or 1,000 gigabytes, about enough to hold 300 hours of high-quality video.Another part of the cloud services’ pitch to would-be customers is that their analytic tools can fish out genetic gold - a drug target, say, or a DNA variant that strongly predicts disease risk - from a sea of data. Any discoveries made through such searches belong to the owners of the data.“On the local university server it might take months to run a computationally-intense” analysis, said Alzheimer’s project leader Dr. Gerard Schellenberg of the University of Pennsylvania. “On Amazon, it’s, ‘how fast do you need it done?’, and they do it.”Another selling point is security. Universities are “generally pretty porous,” said Ryan Permeh, chief scientist at cybersecurity company Cylance Inc., of Irvine, California, and the security of federal government computers is “not at the top of the class.”While academic and pharmaceutical research projects are the biggest customers for genomics cloud services, they will be overtaken by clinical applications in the next 10 years, said Google Genomics director of engineering David Glazer.Individual doctors will regularly access a cloud service to understand how a patient’s genetic profile affects his risk of various diseases or his likely response to medication.“We are at that transition point now,” Glazer said.Matt Wood, general manager for Data Science at Amazon Web Services, sees cloud demand in genomics now as “a perfect storm,” as the amount of data being created, the need for collaboration and the move of genomics into clinical care accelerate.Experts on DNA and data say without access to the cloud, modern genomics would grind to a halt.Bioinformatics expert Dr. Atul Butte of the University of California, San Francisco, said that now, when researchers at different universities are jointly working on NIH and other genomic data, they don’t have to figure out how to make their computers talk to each other. In March, NIH cleared the way for major research on the cloud when it began allowing scientists to upload important genomic data.“My response was, it’s about time,” Butte said."

2015-6-10,FDA panel backs Amgen\'s cholesterol drug for high-risk patients,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN0OQ2MJ20150610,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An advisory panel to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommended approval of Amgen Inc’s cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha on Wednesday, but said it should be used only in patients at high risk of cardiovascular disease.The panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of the drug, known also as evolocumab, for patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH), a hereditary disorder characterized by high LDL levels that can cause heart attacks in very young people.The panel also recommended approval of Repatha in patients without HoFH who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease and are taking other cholesterol treatments, with a 11-4 vote.The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisory panels but typically does so.Repatha is one of a new class of cholesterol-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. Unlike statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, which are pills, PCSK9 inhibitors are biologic drugs given by injection. They are expected to be far more expensive than statins.The panel on Tuesday recommended approval for another PCSK9 drug, Praluent, made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA.The FDA is expected to makes its approval decisions this summer.Repatha is designed to be given in biweekly doses of 140 mg or a monthly dose of 420 mg, on top of statins if patients can tolerate them.Panelists raised questions about what physicians should do if Repatha, combined with statins, were to cause LDL, or so-called bad cholesterol, to drop too low. They fear that if physicians become alarmed by very low LDL levels they could cut back on the patient’s statin, which would not be desirable since there is a large body of data showing that statins reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.Panelists were reluctant to recommend the drug for a wider patient population until Amgen completes a large trial to assess whether Repatha’s cholesterol-lowering impact translates into a reduction in cardiovascular risk.Positive results from the outcomes study could eventually expand use of the medicines. If approved, Praluent and Repatha are expected to generate annual sales of more than $2.5 billion each by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.However, pharmacy benefit managers, such as Express Scripts and CVS Health, are expected to demand steep discounts from the drugmakers in exchange for favoring use of one medicine or the other as they have with new hepatitis C treatments.Amgen’s shares were flat in after-hours trading after rising 0.5 percent to close at $155.55 on Nasdaq.

However, the modest vision improvement seen with AVA-101 in the study may have been disappointing to investors, and the stock changed course, falling 35 percent.The medicine is injected into the lower retina, instead of into the vitreous fluid, the mode of delivery used for existing treatments such as Roche Holding AG’s Lucentis and Regeneron Inc’s Eylea.Like those treatments, the Avalanche product is meant to stem the proliferation of blood vessels in the eye that leak and damage vision.All subjects in the 32-patient study received prior treatment with Lucentis (ranibizumab). Those who then received the Avalanche drug on average gained 2.2 letters on an eye chart, while those who did not saw their vision decrease by 9.3 letters.While the 11.5-letter difference was deemed to be significant, patients in earlier studies of Eylea and Lucentis tended to experience greater vision improvement.A larger percentage of patients who received AVA-101 maintained stable vision, while more patients in the control group required rescue therapy with Lucentis, the company said.The treatments work by blocking a protein called VEGF.

2015-6-26,New Sanofi CEO to unveil five-year plan in November -unions,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N0ZC0S520150626,"(Updates with detail on CEO, context on challenges facing company)PARIS, June 26 (Reuters) - Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt has told unions he will present a five-year strategic plan in November after the French company’s third-quarter results, labour representatives said.Brandicourt said shortly after taking the helm of the drugs company in April that he was launching a strategic review to be completed in the fourth quarter.His plan will be closely watched by both staff and investors, following the sacking last October of previous CEO Chris Viehbacher, who clashed with the board.In his first formal gathering with unions on Thursday, Brandicourt said the cost of operating Sanofi’s industrial sites was weighing on the company’s gross profit margin, according to a union official who was at the meeting and asked not to be named.Sanofi declined to comment.Unions have expressed concerns over production sites and research spending after the loss of several hundred jobs due to restructuring.Union officials said they had also requested the opening of negotiations on salary increases after a two-year pay freeze.Remuneration has been a sensitive issue at Sanofi after a shareholder row over a joining bonus for Brandicourt, as well as severance payments for his predecessor.For shareholders, the focus will be on how Brandicourt plans to ensure growth at a time of big challenges to its core diabetes business and rapid changes in the wider healthcare sector, which has seen more than $250 billion of deals this year.The commercial performance of Sanofi’s top-selling insulin drug Lantus is a worry, with competitive pressures mounting and uncertainty over how well the follow-on product Toujeo will fare.More generally, investors want to see what sort of power the new CEO will really wield, given Viehbacher’s past disputes with the board.Viehbacher left after a disagreement over his management style, according to Sanofi. Company insiders said some board members saw his approach as too authoritarian and a decision to explore selling mature drugs had ruffled feathers, since it put French jobs at risk.Brandicourt, a Paris-educated doctor who previously headed Bayer’s healthcare arm, needs to take such sensitivities into account while also retaining the group’s global focus.Sanofi is a leading player in emerging markets and is also heavily reliant on the U.S. market, which remains the biggest and most profitable in the world for pharmaceutical companies.It has high hopes for a new type of cholesterol-lowering drug called Praluent, developed with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , which was recommended for approval by a U.S. advisory panel this month. Amgen has a similar drug nearing the market. (Additional reporting by Ben Hirschler; Writing by Tim Hepher; Editing by David Holmes)"

2015-7-13,"Anacor skin cream succeeds in studies, fuels takeover expectations",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0PN17020150713,"(Reuters) - Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental skin ointment succeeded in late-stage studies, taking the drugmaker a step closer to having a potential blockbuster in its portfolio and raising expectations that it could be taken over.The company’s shares, which have more than quadrupled in the past year up to Friday’s close, rose more than 50 percent on Monday to a life high of $127.19.“Personally, I’d love to see Anacor independent a little bit longer, but I don’t think its going to happen,” said Paul Yook, portfolio manager at BioShares Biotechnology Funds, which holds a stake in the drugmaker.Analysts said they expected the ointment to eclipse $1 billion in sales and potentially be prescribed as a first-line treatment for atopic dermatitis, an unsightly skin condition characterized by itchiness and inflammation.That could make Anacor an attractive target.Potential bidders could include Novartis AG, Allergan Plc and Japan’s Astellas Pharma Inc, among others, Yook said.Yook said he expected any offer for Anacor to be at a per share premium of 50-90 percent.That compares with the 23.5 percent premium Allergan agreed to pay for Kythera Biopharmaceuticals Inc and its double-chin product in a $2.1 billion deal in June.Anacor represents the “holy grail of biotech company investment,” Yook said, pointing to the company’s robust portfolio, including the potential blockbuster skin ointment that Anacor is developing without a partner.The ointment, Crisaborole, cleared two late-stage studies testing it for use in atopic dermatitis and was successful in both children and adults, the company said.Atopic dermatitis affects about 18-25 million people in the United States, mostly infants and children, Anacor said.Existing treatments include topical cortical steroids, which can weaken skin, and non-steroidal treatments, such as Novartis AG’s Elidel and Astellas Pharma US Inc’s Protopic, which have been linked with cancer.Other companies developing treatments for atopic dermatitis include Oculus Innovative Sciences Inc, Pfizer Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, and Celsus Therapeutics Plc.Palo Alto, California-based Anacor said it expects to submit a marketing application for the drug in the first half of 2016.Wedbush Securities’s David Nierengarten said Crisaborole’s safety and efficacy profile would make it the best product in its class.Shares of the company, which is also testing Crisaborole for psoriasis, were up 48.4 percent at $125.60 on Monday, making them the top percentage gainer on the Nasdaq."

Further studies are now underway to establish this.The competing products target the PCSK9 protein that maintains “bad” LDL cholesterol in the blood. Statins, like Pfizer’s Lipitor, work very differently, blocking the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol, which is linked with heart attacks and strokes. (Editing by William Hardy)"

2015-7-24,FDA approves Sanofi\\/Regeneron cholesterol drug with limits,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1041QX20150724,"(Updates share price, adds AHIP and ACC comments)WASHINGTON, July 24 (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a potent new cholesterol-lowering drug from Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Friday but limited its approved use to patients with a hereditary form of the condition and those with cardiovascular disease.The FDA ruling came just hours after European regulators recommended approval for broader use of the drug, called Praluent, in all patients with high cholesterol who are not able to lower it even by taking maximal doses of statin therapy.The companies expect the drug to receive formal approval by the European Commission in late September. The commission recently approved a rival drug, Repatha, made by Amgen Inc .The FDA approved Praluent for patients with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, including those who have had heart attacks or strokes. It also approved the drug for heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH), the most common hereditary form of high cholesterol.Regeneron said between 8 and 10 million people fall into those categories.Investors had hoped the FDA would also approve the drug for patients with non-hereditary high cholesterol who cannot tolerate, or do not respond to, statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. Statins are widely available in cheaper generic form.“Investors are citing the lack of inclusion of primary prevention as more narrow than expected,” said Mark Schoenebaum, an analyst at Evercore ISI. Shares of Regeneron fell 2.7 percent to $541.85.Praluent is given every other week by injection in doses of 75 mg or 150 mg. Regeneron said both doses of its drug will be priced wholesale at $1,120 for a 28-day supply. That equates to roughly $14,560 a year.Some analysts had expected the company to charge less for the lower dose, and had expected a lower price overall, even after rebates are taken into account.“Assuming 15 percent gross to net this would imply a net price of $12,400 a year, while we think investors were anticipating a net annual price of approximately $10,000 a year,” said Phil Nadeau, an analyst at Cowen and Co.America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, protested the high price.“While the FDA’s focused guidance recognizes the safety and effectiveness of this treatment for certain patients, the exorbitant price raises concerns as to whether consumers and the health system can sustain the long-term costs,” the group’s interim chief executive, Dan Durham, said in a statement.Praluent and Repatha are the first of a new class of LDL-lowering drugs that inhibit a protein known as PCSK9.On July 21, European regulators approved Repatha with a broad label covering patients with all familial hypercholesteremia, including the rare, homozygous form, and those with non-hereditary high cholesterol.The FDA is expected to rule on Repatha by Aug. 27. Amgen’s shares fell 3.4 percent to $158.59.Repatha is given as a 140 mg injection every other week or as a monthly injection of 420 mg.In limiting the approved patient population for Praluent, the FDA followed the advice of its advisory panel, which in June recommended use be limited to patients with a genetic predisposition to high cholesterol and those at high cardiovascular risk who are on maximum doses of statins.Dr. Kim Allan Williams Sr., president of the American College of Cardiology (ACC), urged physicians to limit use of the drug to high-risk patients until results come in from trials on whether the drug’s ability to reduce cholesterol translates into a lower rate of heart attacks and strokes.“The ACC eagerly awaits the results of clinical trials that are in progress,” Williams said in a statement. “In the meantime, we continue to recommend physicians limit prescribing to the very high risk, hard-to-treat group approved by the FDA.”Physicians can prescribe drugs “off label” to any patient even if the FDA has not approved it for that patient group, but insurance companies may not pay and companies cannot market the drugs for unapproved uses.CVS Health Corp, whose pharmacy benefit division negotiates drug prices for 65 million plan members, has warned it will require patients to obtain approval before it will pay for the drugs.“We will try to avoid situations in which a patient has not had a good trial of a statin medication or situations where patients appear to be intolerant but there is no biochemical evidence of problems with liver or muscle enzymes,” Dr. Troyen Brennan, CVS’s chief medical officer, said in an interviewCVS and other large payers such as Express Scripts Holding Co put pressure on Gilead Sciences Inc to lower the price of its $1,000 hepatitis C pill after it was launched in late 2013. Gilead was forced to discount its price after a rival drug from AbbVie Inc emerged late last year.Praluent and Repatha are expected to generate annual sales of more than $2 billion by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.

2015-7-27,New heart drugs come in more expensive than expected,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N1060A920150727,"* Sanofi, Novartis set high prices for Praluent, Entresto* Bullish prices fuel multibillion-dollar sales forecasts* Healthcare providers fear new drugs will strain budgetsLONDON, July 27 (Reuters) - Two of the most anticipated new heart drugs to be launched in recent years have been priced well above analyst expectations, fuelling the debate about whether modern medicines cost too much.Praluent, made by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, and Entresto from Novartis are both treatments that represent significant advances for millions of patients at risk of serious heart problems.But their positioning in the marketplace was always likely to be contentious since they offer more effective alternatives to very cheap, off-patent drugs.The manufacturers have taken an ambitious view on pricing, arguing that the clear medical benefits of their products and their ability to keep patients out of expensive hospital beds, make them cost-effective choices for healthcare providers.The high prices have also prompted rising sales forecasts, but they may provoke clashes with the providers.Sanofi and Regeneron, which won U.S. approval on Friday for Praluent to treat stubbornly high cholesterol, said the injection would cost $14,600 a year, well above the roughly $10,000 investors had expected.Tim Race of Deutsche Bank said the high official price would allow the companies to offer generous rebates in what is expected to be a competitive market, resulting in a net price that could be discounted by 30-50 percent over time.Sanofi and Regeneron are competing against Amgen’s Repatha, another so-called PCSK9 inhibitor, which is still awaiting a green light in the United States, although it was approved last week in Europe.Still, setting a high price is a gamble as it could drive healthcare providers to put restrictions on Praluent’s use, according to Joseph Schwartz of Leerink, who had been modelling a below-consensus price of about just $5,000.On July 7, Novartis set a price of $4,560 a year for its new heart failure pill Entresto, nearly 50 percent higher than many analysts had expected.Novartis does not face direct competition to Entresto but the company has said it will offer discount deals, including basing the amount paid on patients’ clinical outcomes.Big U.S. pharmacy benefit managers such as Express Scripts and CVS Health, who negotiate drug prices for health plan members, have already warned that the cost of new heart drugs - particularly PCSK9s - will strain budgets.Leading heart doctors, while welcoming the arrival of novel weapons to keep heart troubles at bay, have also cited price as a potential problem.The new heart drugs cost nowhere near as much as many modern cancer drugs, often priced at more than $100,000, but their impact on budgets will be considerable since they are designed for lifetime use.Praluent and Amgen’s Repatha are expected to generate global annual sales of more than $2 billion each by 2020, according to consensus forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters Cortellis.Entresto is forecast to sell nearly $5 billion by the same date, a figure that has been climbing since the price was set.

The new drugs work by blocking the protein PCSK9, whose natural function is to prevent “bad” LDL cholesterol from being removed from the bloodstream.Express Scripts, which administers drug benefits for employers and health plans and also runs large mail-order pharmacies, has been challenging the rising cost of new medications.“While these drugs are being viewed as breakthroughs, they also have the potential to wreak financial havoc on clients who do not proactively manage” their drug costs, Express Scripts President Tim Wentworth said during a conference call to discuss the company’s quarterly earnings.Glen Stettin, a senior Express Scripts executive, said an estimated 70 million Americans have high cholesterol.He estimates fewer than 10 percent of them should qualify for Praluent, based on restrictions from the Food and Drug Administration, which limited the drug’s use mostly to patients with a hereditary form of high cholesterol and people with cardiovascular disease.“The big worry for our clients, given the cost of these drugs, is whether they will be used beyond ways they were tested,” Stettin said.Before getting their prescriptions filled, patients in Express Scripts plans will be asked for documentation of their diagnosis, their cholesterol levels, diet and maximum tolerated statin therapy, Stettin said.Express Scripts has become a vocal critic of highly priced medicines, including Sovaldi, an $84,000 hepatitis C treatment from Gilead Sciences Inc. A rival treatment from AbbVie Inc was approved late last year, and Express Scripts successfully pressured both companies to lower prices.Similarly, Stettin said the expected approval of Amgen’s cholesterol fighter, Repatha, should help Express Scripts push for lower prices on both drugs.“We love competition because we know we can leverage that,” Stettin said. He declined to estimate how big the discounts might be.Officials at Regeneron were not available to comment. Amgen, in an emailed statement, said it believes its Repatha will offer value for those who need to further reduce their LDL. “We look forward to working with payers to ensure that these patients can access Repatha, and that it fits within the needs of the overall healthcare system,” the company said.

Amgen gets about 22 percent of its sales from overseas.Enbrel sales rose 8 percent to $1.36 billion, driven by price increases despite a highly competitive market. Analysts had been looking for about $1.25 billion.Osteoporosis drug Prolia also topped expectations by about $30 million with sales of $340 million for the quarter.Sales of the infection-fighting white blood cell boosters Neulasta and Neupogen, which are bracing for competition from new biosimilar versions, were in line with expectations at $1.41 billion.Amgen has been working to cut costs. Research and development expense was down 6 percent and operating expenses fell 1 percent.Net profit rose to $1.65 billion, or $2.15 per share, from $1.55 billion, or $2.01, a year ago.

Later this year, once a competing drug from Amgen Inc is approved, its pharmacy committee will review if it will add both drugs to its formulary.Express Scripts added back about 10 drugs that had been cut from the list in 2015, saying it negotiated better prices with their manufacturers. It said that in 2016, the cuts will save its customers $1.3 billion, up from the $1.05 billion it estimates in savings for 2015. There are about 4,000 drugs on the market, it said.

The drug has since been approved for macular edema, a build-up of fluid in the back of the eye, and a related sight-robbing condition called diabetic macular edema.The key indication where Regeneron expects growth in Eylea sales is diabetic macular edema, Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said on a call with analysts.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt expects Eylea sales to grow on the back of data showing that it was better than Roche AG’s Avastin and Lucentis.Regeneron now expects Eylea sales to grow 45-50 percent in 2015, up from 30-35 percent it had estimated earlier.The company did not provide a forecast for its new cholesterol drug, Praluent, developed in partnership with French drugmaker Sanofi SA.Analysts expect Praluent, approved on July 24, to be the next focus for investors. Guggenheim Securities analyst Tony Butler expects Regeneron to provide an update on Praluent at the end of the third quarter.Leerink Partners analysts expect the drug to hit peak annual sales of more than $5 billion.On Tuesday, Regeneron warned that Praluent sales may rise only gradually and “for next several months, performance cannot be judged based upon reported sales.”The company blamed a possible delay in decisions by insurance companies on the drug’s coverage as well as Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.A part of its target population could stay on successful statin treatments, the company said.Praluent’s wholesale price is $1,120 for 28 days, much higher than the $50 that statins and their generics cost for a month.Express Scripts Holding Corp, the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager, said last week that Praluent’s high price would raise healthcare costs, but it added the drug to its 2016 formulary.

2015-8-09,CVS: \'all bets are off\' for new cholesterol drug contracts,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0QF05120150810,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, the No 2 manager of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers, will wait until a second new cholesterol-lowering drug is approved by regulators before negotiating for price discounts or adding either of the much pricer new drugs to its list of covered medications.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in July approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA’s Praluent, which works by blocking a protein called PCSK9 that helps “bad” LDL cholesterol stay in the bloodstream. An FDA decision on a second PCSK9 inhibitor, Amgen Inc’s Repatha, is expected later this month.CVS and other pharmacy benefit managers are concerned about the cost of the PCSK9s compared to older cholesterol fighters such as statins, which are available as generics for less than $50 a month. Praluent, given by injection, has a list price of almost $15,000 a year.“It’s smart to wait and see what the competitor medication looks like in terms of what the FDA label is,” Dr Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer at CVS, told Reuters, referring to the type of patients who should be given the drug.Brennan added that “all bets are off” in negotiations between CVS and the PCSK9 drugmakers in terms of which, if either, of the drugs would be added to its formulary, or list of covered medications.Currently, doctors seeking to prescribe Praluent have to go through a “formulary exception process,” to secure CVS coverage.Brennan said an exclusive agreement for one of the new drugs would be “a tried and true method” for obtaining the best pricing, but CVS could have deals to place both drugs on its formulary.He said CVS will institute a “utilization management program,” taking into account issues such as patient history of heart disease or diabetes, as well as overall risk for cardiovascular disease. “We expect patients to first use statins,” Brennan said. “If they can’t use statins, or can’t make (LDL) targets, then they would use PCSK9 inhibitors.”CVS estimates that about 73 million Americans have elevated cholesterol. Brennan forecast that less than 1 percent of current statin users will be switched to PCSK9s in the first year they are on the market. “That could change as new data comes in on outcome measures,” he said.Brennan said Praluent will first be used by the small number of people who are genetically predisposed to high cholesterol. “For those patients, the use of this drug is less expensive than the drugs they were on,” he said."
2015-8-10,Pharmacy benefit manager CVS urges rewrite for U.S. heart guidelines,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0QF1RY20150810,"(Reuters) - CVS Health Corp, the second-largest manager of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers, asked heart specialists on Monday to revamp guidelines for treating patients with high cholesterol after the launch of new, expensive medications.The unusual move is the latest salvo in the war on escalating U.S. healthcare costs, with insurers using aggressive tactics to extract steep price discounts from drugmakers, even for the newest medications, and controlling patient access to the most expensive drugs.CVS, in a letter published in the latest edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association, said current guidelines, which include a formula for assessing heart disease risk rather than specific targets for levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol, do not provide clarity on how to choose the best, and most cost effective, therapy.CVS says LDL targets are needed now that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved Praluent, a potent new drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA that works by blocking a protein called PCSK9 that helps LDL cholesterol stay in the bloodstream. An FDA decision on a second PCSK9 inhibitor, Amgen Inc’s Repatha, is expected later this month.CVS and other pharmacy benefit managers are concerned about the cost of the PCSK9s compared with older cholesterol fighters such as statins, which are available as generics for less than $50 a month. Praluent, given by injection, has a list price of almost $15,000 a year.Both Praluent and Repatha, in combination with statins, have been shown to lower cholesterol by around 60 percent compared with statins alone.“The current cholesterol management guidelines do not provide clarity as to how these expensive new medications could fit in the treatment paradigm, potentially resulting in some scenarios where a prescriber could consider a PCSK9 inhibitor for a low-risk patient,” Dr. William Shrank, chief scientific officer at CVS, said in a statement.The latest treatment guidelines, issued in 2013 by the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, overturned decades of practice in which doctors screened patients for high cholesterol, then sought to reduce LDL to a specific level.The new guidelines dropped an emphasis on specific targets for LDL levels. Instead, they suggest that an individual patient’s risk of developing heart disease rather than an LDL number should be used to determine the need for more intensive treatment.Dr. Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer for CVS, said that if the guidelines are not changed, CVS will use its own targets, which will vary depending on patient history. “We expect patients to first use statins,” he said. “If they can’t use statins, or can’t make (LDL) targets, then they would use PCSK9 inhibitors.”Some prominent cardiologists have questioned the 2013 guidelines, but the ACC and AHA have shown little appetite to return to LDL targets. “LDL may or may not correlate to cardiovascular outcomes,” Dr. Kim Allan Williams, president of the ACC, told Reuters last week.Williams said on Monday, “The potential of this new class of drugs is exciting, and we look forward to data from the clinical trials in progress that could demonstrate whether these new cholesterol-lowering drugs will benefit a wider group of patients. In the meantime, ... any changes to them (guidelines) must be supported by evidence.”The AHA said in response to a request for comments, “We continually weigh our recommendations against current science and update our guidance accordingly.”When Praluent was approved last month, Williams said the ACC recommended that doctors limit prescribing PCSK9 inhibitors “to the very high risk, hard-to-treat groups approved by the FDA.” In addition, he said patients should otherwise follow the current cholesterol guidelines, which recommend lifestyle changes and, if needed, statins for most patients with or at risk of heart disease.CVS estimates that about 73 million Americans have elevated cholesterol.“PCSK9 inhibitors will be used chronically — generally for the remainder of the lives of treated patients,” CVS said in its letter. “As a result, most payers, both government and commercial, are probably considering thoughtful ways to rationalize the use of these medications.”"

The drugs belong to a potent new class of injectable LDL-lowering drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors.Repatha was approved to treat patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and patients with the rarer homozygous (HoFH) form of the disease. It was also approved for patients with cardiovascular disease including heart attack or stroke, who require additional cholesterol lowering.Amgen’s shares rose 0.5 percent to $156.50 in extended trading.The scope of the approval was similar to the approval given to the Regeneron drug, Praluent, which was approved for patients with cardiovascular disease and those with HeFH.The drugs are expected to generate more than $2 billion a year each in sales by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.“The back-to-back approvals for Praluent and Repatha should allow natural market competition to influence the immediate cost for the PCSK9 inhibitors,” Steve Miller, chief medical officer at pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co, said in an emailed statement.“And we plan to leverage this competition to achieve the greatest possible discounts for our clients and patients.”Praluent is given every other week by injection in doses of 75 mg or 150 mg. Both doses of the drug will be priced wholesale at $1,120 for a 28-day supply, or roughly $14,560 a year.After rebates, analysts expect the drug to cost about $12,400 a year.Repatha is given as a 140 mg injection every other week or as a monthly injection of 420 mg. Amgen said the wholesale cost of the drug will be $14,100 a year for the every other week injection. The product will be available next week.Amgen said it plans to make the monthly dosing option available next year.The drugs are more potent than traditional cholesterol-lowering statin drugs, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor. But it is not yet known whether their cholesterol-lowering power will translate into a reduced number of heart attacks.The companies are conducting so-called cardiovascular outcomes trials to determine whether their ability to dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol will lead to fewer heart attacks, strokes and deaths.America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, has protested the high price of Praluent, saying it has concerns about the health system’s ability to sustain the long-term costs."

2015-8-30,"Alnylam, Medicines cholesterol drug lasts months after one shot",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0QZ08320150830,"LONDON (Reuters) - A new drug in early development cuts cholesterol as much as two potent injections recently cleared for sale but lasts much longer, meaning it may need to be given only every three to six months, initial findings suggest.Results with Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Medicines Co’s experimental product ALN-PCSsc highlight the competition for a market tipped to generate billions of dollars in sales.Unlike rival antibody-based PCSK9 medicines that work in the blood, the new under-the-skin injection is a first-in-class treatment that stops synthesis of the protein which is linked to “bad” LDL cholesterol in the liver.Targeting PCSK9 is a hot area for drug companies seeking to cut heart risks for millions of people who don’t benefit from conventional statin drugs.Amgen’s Repatha and a rival product, Praluent, from Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, are each expected to generate more than $2 billion a year in sales by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.Pfizer also has a PCSK9 drug in late-stage trials, and is experimenting with an oral pill.Alnylam and Medicines Co’s product will be relatively late to the party, as it is unlikely to go on sale before 2020 even if subsequent late-stage studies are successful, but its reduced injection frequency could make it an attractive option.Results from 69 patients in a Phase I trial, reported at the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) congress on Sunday, found a single dose of 300 mg reduced LDL by just over 50 percent at 12 weeks, similar to the 50-60 percent seen with antibody drugs, and the reduction was still 44 percent after 140 days.“We’re not quite sure exactly how long this stuff lasts but we know it is more than 140 days for many patients,” Medicines Co Chief Executive Clive Meanwell told Reuters.“The ability to control LDL cholesterol with an injection every three to six months will mean patients can get their cholesterol checked while doctors decide if they need another shot, which should improve adherence.”ALN-PCSsc was generally well tolerated with no significant adverse events, though bigger safety and efficacy studies are needed. Medicines Co plans to start a Phase II study by end-2015 and a final-stage Phase III trial by end-2017.The new drug uses a novel approach known as RNA interference, or gene silencing, to stop the synthesis of PCSK9, giving it the ability to knock down the protein with an injection administered once-quarterly or possibly bi-annually.“It is a follower, but really it’s more of a next-generation idea,” said Meanwell.Cost is a major issue for PCSK9 drugs, with Repatha and Praluent priced at more than $14,000 a year, before discounts. Meanwell said the new drug would probably be cheaper to make but its price would be determined by the value it offered.Jefferies analysts currently model peak ALN-PCSsc sales of $980 million, after applying a 50 percent risk discount because the drug is still at an early stage.Shares in Medicines Co and Alnylam rose 6 and 4 percent respectively on Friday ahead of the ESC meeting."
2015-9-01,Europe gets Amgen cholesterol drug for 50-60 percent of U.S. price,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0R13VI20150901,"LONDON (Reuters) - Amgen is launching its injectable cholesterol drug in Europe at around half the U.S. price, in a move likely to stoke controversy about the way Americans end up paying far more than others for new medicines.Repatha belongs to a potent and expensive new class of drugs for lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol, whose high cost has prompted concerns among healthcare providers and doctors.U.S.-based Amgen said on Tuesday it would charge 340.20 pounds ($521.70) in Britain for a 28-day supply of Repatha, or roughly $6,780 a year, against a list price of $14,100 in the United States, where the drug is also being launched this week.In Austria and Finland, a year’s supply will cost around 7,293 and 7,825 euros ($8,220 and $8,820) respectively. Prices have yet to be determined for other European Union markets.Repatha is a so-called PCSK9 inhibitor, which is more powerful than cheap statin pills that are effective for most people with high cholesterol.A rival PCSK9 product called Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, which has a U.S. price tag of $14,600, is still awaiting final European approval.Both drugs are expected to generate more than $2 billion a year each in sales by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.The fact that U.S. drug prices are often significantly higher than those in other markets has led to persistent complaints that Americans effectively subsidize the rest of the world in paying for drug development.While PCSK9 drugs could help millions of people who fail to hit their LDL goals on statins, managers of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers say their high cost could “wreak havoc” on the healthcare system.Manufacturers, however, argue that the drugs can save money by preventing heart attacks and keeping patients out of costly hospital beds. As the medicines consist of antibodies, they are also more expensive to make than conventional statins.The question of how PCSK9 drugs should be prescribed has dominated debate at this week’s annual meeting of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) in London. Many heart specialists believe they will be given sparingly, at least at first.In Europe, in particular, demand is likely to be curbed by budget-conscious governments, many of which have set up healthcare cost agencies to assess new drug use.In Britain, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence is expected to issue guidance next April on whether Repatha should be used on the state health service.A desire by companies to ensure products are recommended by such agencies is one reason why drug prices are often set lower in Europe than in the United States.An Amgen spokeswoman said prices were set to reflect “the unique healthcare environment and marketplace” of different countries.Lars Ryden, a cardiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said he expected PCSK9 costs would come down within a couple of years as other companies, like Pfizer, enter the market. But for the time being authorities will be cautious.“I’m quite sure that in Sweden the use will be very selective,” he told Reuters.Austrian cardiologist Heinz Drexel said the new drugs were likely to be reserved at first mainly for patients with severe familial high cholesterol or those suffering successive heart attacks.Among his acute coronary syndrome patients, Drexel said he expected to give PCSK9 injections to only a “single digit percent” over the coming year. However, usage could pick up once long-term studies testing efficacy in preventing heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular deaths report results in 2017.Currently, Repatha and Praluent are given once every two weeks, although Amgen plans to offer a once-monthly option next year. But the ESC congress also saw promising early results with a new PCSK9 drug that could be given once every three to six months.($1 = 0.6521 pounds)($1 = 0.8871 euros)"

2015-9-01,Industry complains to EU over French law pushing cheap eye drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0R14DS20150901,"(Reuters) - Europe’s pharmaceuticals industry said on Tuesday it had filed a complaint with the European Commission against a French law promoting the use of Roche’s cancer drug Avastin as a cheap eye treatment.The move is the latest salvo in a lengthy battle between drugmakers, who argue Avastin has never been authorized for eye therapy, and cost-conscious European healthcare providers, who contend it works as well as far more costly alternatives.The European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations (EFPIA) said the French decision to allow such so-called off-label drug use on economic grounds circumvented EU rules designed to ensure the proper use of medicines.“It is simply not acceptable for policy makers concerned with the size of healthcare spending to introduce legislation that not only contradicts EU law, but also puts the overall EU regulatory system aimed at guaranteeing the highest patient safety standards at risk,” said EFPIA director general Richard Bergstrom.“The pharmaceutical industry collectively calls on the European Commission to address this public health issue urgently and preserve those safeguards that have been put in place.”The French medicines regulator ANSM decided earlier this year that Avastin should be allowed for the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and the law became effective on Sept. 1.Although Roche’s Avastin is not approved by health regulators as a treatment for AMD, it works in a similar way to the treatments currently authorized for AMD, such as Lucentis, marketed by Novartis and Roche, and Eylea, from Bayer and Regeneron.France has argued that encouraging the use of Avastin, which costs around 30 times less than those rival treatments, could bring annual savings of some 200 million euros ($225 million).Italy has also taken action to encourage the use of Avastin in AMD.($1 = 0.8873 euros)"
2015-9-02,Regeneron scientists discover key to excess bone growth in rare disease,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0R222Z20150902,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Scientists at U.S. biotechnology company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals researching a rare genetic disease that traps sufferers in a second skeleton have discovered a treatment that shuts down excessive bone growth in mice engineered to develop the illness.Company scientists said on Wednesday the protein Activin-A, which normally blocks bone growth, triggers hyperactive bone growth in patients with a genetic mutation that causes the disease. The disease is known as Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva, or FOP.The researchers showed that an antibody that blocks Activin-A helped shut down the growth signal in genetically modified mice. The effect lasted as long as six weeks, according to the study, published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.Aris Economides, executive director of skeletal diseases and co-founder of the Regeneron Genetics Center, said the findings could eventually lead to a treatment for the disease. FOP is a lethal genetic disorder in which muscle and soft tissue gradually are replaced by bone, forming an extra skeleton that immobilizes and eventually suffocates patients.The condition currently affects 800 people globally, including 200 in the United States.FOP is caused by mutations in the gene ACVR1 which makes a receptor that controls bone growth in cells. Regeneron discovered that this mutated receptor has an abnormal response in the presence of Activin-A, a growth factor often secreted by the immune system in response to injury and inflammation.Normally, Activin-A blocks the receptor, putting the brakes on bone growth. In individuals with the FOP mutation, Activin-A has the opposite effect. “It’s as if the brakes are hot-wired to the gas pedal,” Economides told Reuters.The finding explains how abnormal bone forms in FOP patients, often in response to injuries or illness that cause tissue swelling or inflammation, he said.To test their finding, researchers developed a therapeutic antibody designed to block Activin-A. When injected in mice that developed a form of the disease, the drug blocked the formation of excess bone.Economides said the antibody works in a similar way to Regeneron and Sanofi’s newly approved antibody drug Praluent, a cholesterol-lowering drug which blocks a receptor called PSCK9 on liver cells that controls the removal of “bad” LDL cholesterol.Betsy Bogard, director of global research development for the International FOP Association and the sister of an FOP patient, called Regeneron’s findings “incredibly exciting,” as they help explain some of science behind FOP and also raise hope for a new treatment approach.But Bogard, who is a former executive of the drug company Genzyme, a unit of Sanofi, remained cautious.“The road of developing drugs is long and difficult. There is still much to learn,” she said.Although the company would not disclose details or timing of its development approach, Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie said preclinical testing is ongoing, and the company hopes to move the treatment into human trials.Clementia Pharmaceuticals Inc, a private Montreal-based company, is also studying FOP and is testing a compound called palovarotene. The drug is a repurposed compound acquired from Roche that aims to interrupt the process of bone formation during disease flare-ups. It is now being tested in a phase 2 trial in FOP patients.Last month, Clementia expanded the trial to include children as young as 6, and said it expects to start phase 3 testing in the second half of next year."
2015-9-08,Independent group finds new cholesterol drugs far too costly,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N11E2T120150908,"(Adds Regeneron comment, approval details)Sept 8 (Reuters) - An independent non-profit organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines said announced prices for a just-approved class of potent cholesterol lowering drugs were far too high, according to a draft report released on Tuesday.The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said its analyses indicated “that the price that best represents the overall benefits” the drugs may provide patients would be between $3,615 and $4,811 a year, a 67 percent discount off the list prices.“Even if these drugs were used in just over 25 percent of eligible patients, then employers, insurers, and patients would need to spend on average more than $20 billion a year for these drugs,” ICER president Steven Pearson said in a statement.It would take a further price reduction to an annual cost of $2,177 in order to not have to try to limit patient use to keep overall health care cost growth within bounds, ICER concluded.The new injectable cholesterol fighters belong to a class known as PCSK9 inhibitors that in clinical trials lowered levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol by about 55-60 percent in patients who could not reduce their levels enough with inexpensive, widely-used statins, such as Lipitor, or those who could not tolerate statins. Ongoing studies will determine if they actually cut heart attacks as statins have been shown to do.Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi has a U.S. price of $14,600 for a year of treatment. Amgen Inc set an annual price of $14,100 for its Repatha.Depending on how they are used in practice, it has been estimated that between 3.5 million and 15 million Americans could be eligible for treatment, ICER said.“There are serious questions regarding the price at which these drugs would represent a sensible value to patients and to the health care system,” the report said. ICER found that the two drugs appear to have equivalent overall effectiveness for most patient groups.The drugs were initially approved for use in patients with a hereditary form of extreme high cholesterol and those with heart disease.Amgen said it disagrees with ICER’s methodology, assumptions and preliminary conclusions. “We are concerned that ... its short term budgetary focus will be used to create access barriers to innovative medicines like Repatha for appropriate patients,” Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Neese said in an emailed statement.Regeneron said it needs to better understand the methodology used in the ICER analysis and called for a robust peer review process. “We are committed to providing affordable medicines and ensuring access to Praluent for patients who are prescribed the therapy,” Regeneron spokeswoman Hala Mizra said.The PCSK9 drugs have been in the crosshairs of U.S. pharmacy benefit managers, such as Express Scripts and CVS Health. They hope to gain significant discounts for customers by offering the drugmakers preferential usage status in exchange for lower prices, as they have done with expensive new hepatitis C treatments.Further entry of PCSK9 drugs from Pfizer and others could also lead to lower prices as competition intensifies.

2015-9-11,Novartis heart failure drug should have 17 percent discount: analysis,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0RB23520150911,"(Reuters) - A new Novartis AG drug to treat heart failure should cost 17 percent less than its list price of $4,560 per year to keep health costs in line with growth in the overall U.S. economy, according to the nonprofit ICER.In a draft report released on Friday, the Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review set its “value-based” price for Entresto at $3,799 annually. The independent ICER evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines.The group found that Entresto extends patients’ lives and decreases the risk of hospitalization, but said the budget impact of the drug, which could be used by nearly 2 million Americans in its first five years, is too high at its current price.Novartis, in an emailed statement, said it was “pleased that ICER found Entresto to be cost effective,” but declined to comment on whether it was offering any price discounts to insurers and other healthcare payers. The company has forecast that Entresto could eventually reach more than $5 billion in annual global sales.ICER said the Novartis drug, which was approved by U.S. regulators in July, provides “a small to substantial net health benefit compared to the current standard of care in patients with congestive heart failure.”The draft report also concluded that current evidence is insufficient to determine that heart failure monitor CardioMEMS HF System, marketed by St. Jude Medical Inc, improves patient outcomes. The report estimated a “value-based” benchmark for the device of $7,622, a discount of nearly 60 percent to the current list price.Officials at St. Jude did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Chronic heart failure, in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood, tends to get progressively worse, leaving patients weak and with diminished quality of life. About half of all patients die within five years of diagnosis, often as a result of acute episodes that require urgent hospital care.In a separate report earlier this week, ICER said its analyses found that two new cholesterol drugs, Repatha from Amgen Inc and Praluent from partners Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, should be sold at a 67 percent discount from list prices."

The company has forecast that Entresto could eventually reach more than $5 billion in annual global sales.ICER said the Novartis drug, which was approved by U.S. regulators in July, provides “a small to substantial net health benefit compared to the current standard of care in patients with congestive heart failure.”The draft report also concluded that current evidence is insufficient to determine that heart failure monitor CardioMEMS HF System, marketed by St. Jude Medical Inc, improves patient outcomes. The report estimated a “value-based” benchmark for the device of $7,622, a discount of nearly 60 percent to the current list price.Officials at St. Jude did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Chronic heart failure, in which the heart is unable to pump enough blood, tends to get progressively worse, leaving patients weak and with diminished quality of life. About half of all patients die within five years of diagnosis, often as a result of acute episodes that require urgent hospital care.In a separate report earlier this week, ICER said its analyses found that two new cholesterol drugs, Repatha from Amgen Inc and Praluent from partners Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, should be sold at a 67 percent discount from list prices.

2015-9-11,Amgen seeks FDA approval for monthly dosing option for Repatha,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0RB1K620150911,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Friday it had asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to approve a monthly single-dosing option for its recently approved cholesterol drug, Repatha.The FDA approved Repatha - one of two expensive treatments in a new class of injectable “bad cholesterol”-lowering drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors - in late August.A similar drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA, called Praluent, was approved in July.Repatha is approved for patients with hereditary forms of high cholesterol - heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) and a rarer homozygous (HoFH) form of the condition, in addition to those with cardiovascular disease.It is given as a 140 mg injection every other week or as a monthly injection of 420 mg, which is recommended for HoFH patients, the company said.At the time of approval, Amgen had said it planned to make the monthly dosing option available next year.Praluent, which is given every other week by injection in doses of 75 mg or 150 mg.Praluent has a U.S. price of $14,600 for a year of treatment, while Repatha costs about $14,100. Amgen’s drug is being launched in Europe at around half the U.S. price.In Europe, demand is expected to be limited by budget-conscious governments, many of which have set up healthcare-cost agencies to assess new drugs. Companies often set prices lower to ensure their products are recommended by these agencies.In the United States, CVS Health Corp and other pharmacy benefit managers are unhappy about the cost of the PCSK9s compared to older cholesterol fighters such as statins, which are available as generics for less than $50 a month.Amgen, Regeneron and Sanofi have been accused of setting prices that could wreak havoc on the U.S. healthcare system and limit patient use.But the companies argue that the drugs are more expensive to make and will reduce overall hospital costs because they could prevent heart attacks.Depending on how they are used, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) estimates that between 3.5 million and 15 million Americans could be eligible for treatment."
2015-9-24,Top U.S. doctors say pricey cholesterol drugs best for limited group,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0RO2DD20150924,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Top U.S. heart doctors said on Thursday that newly developed cholesterol treatments that cost more than $14,000 per year are best used for the small group of patients for which they have been approved, at least for now.The drugs are vastly more expensive than the statins that are currently used by tens of millions of people to help control high cholesterol and have drawn scrutiny from health insurers who are concerned they will be widely prescribed.The physicians’ views, detailed during a Rethinking Cholesterol panel presented by Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in collaboration with Reuters, is not much different than that of some health insurers.CVS Health, a pharmacy benefit manager, has set out a program that aims to limit the drug’s use and has said that it would try to use competition to wring steep discounts out of Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi SA, who make the drugs.It is that competition that Paul Ridker said will help get drug prices down - an issue that featured prominently in the U.S. Presidential campaign this week when Hillary Clinton unveiled a plan to cap drug costs.“The price tag is exceptionally high. The good news is three different companies and potentially as many as five may have products in this arena soon, and hopefully competition will bring us there,” Paul Ridker, a cardiovascular specialist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said during the panel.“This is the first time we are going to see the payers really exert their influence here as much as the physicians and the patients and that’s going to be an interesting twist for the story,” Ridker said.How much drugs should cost is a difficult question, the panelists said. An independent non-profit organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines said earlier this month that these same cholesterol drugs were not cost effective if used by the 3.5 million to 15 million Americans who could be eligible for treatment.There are several trials underway aimed at determining how much these new drugs cut the risk of heart attacks and deaths.Patrick O’Gara, ex-president of the American College of Cardiology, said that he is concerned that people who think they are statin intolerant will seek out this drug.“Release of these medications in an unfiltered way to a large number of patents with statin intolerance is a very worrisome proposition at this point and time, looking ahead and thinking about cost,” O’Gara said."

2016-1-08,Healthcare investors brace for busy week as U.S. conference kicks off,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N14S10W20160108,"Jan 8 (Reuters) - Healthcare investors can expect a volatile week starting on Monday when the sector’s biggest financial event hits San Francisco.The annual JP Morgan healthcare conference, in which many healthcare companies present product and financial news to would-be investors, has been credited for helping the January outperformance of the healthcare sector in recent years.But after a strong five-year period saw the sector grow to 15.2 percent of the S&P 500 index from 10.9 percent in 2010, investors are concerned that political threats to drug pricing and uncertainty about Obamacare could hurt the sector.“There are probably 15 to 20 high profile companies that will give some formal guidance” at the conference, said David Heupel, a healthcare analyst at Thrivent Investment Management in Minneapolis. “You see either the group is in pretty good shape or maybe 2016 is going to be a little less robust than expectations.”The S&P healthcare sector is still reasonably priced relative to the broader market, with the index’s price roughly 16.1 times earnings expected over the next 12 months, compared to the 16.5 level for the S&P 500 index. And even at 15.2 percent of the S&P, healthcare stocks still make up less than the 17.4 percent that healthcare spending contributed to U.S. gross domestic product in 2013, the most recently aggregated data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis.Listening for answers at the conference will be roughly 3,000 investors like Les Funtleyder, healthcare portfolio manager for E Squared Asset Management in New York.“For the first part of the year, (the conference is) actually very important,” said Funtleyder. “It sets the tone.”JP Morgan says it expects roughly 9,000 attendees and presentations from more than 400 biotech, pharmaceutical, medical device, health insurance and other healthcare companies, a similar amount to last year.As individual companies take the podium at the conference, their shares could gyrate significantly.For example, Celgene Corp, whose stock soared 17 percent during the week of the conference in 2013 after it issued a long-term outlook, is among companies expected to give key financial data this year, along with rival large-cap biotech firms Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Vertex Pharmaceuticals.The climate for deals - including those already struck and the outlook for more consolidation - will also be in focus.Top executives at insurers Anthem and Aetna , both of which are trying to gain clearance for massive acquisitions, could give investors more confidence those deals will pass anti-trust scrutiny.Shire Pharmaceuticals Plc could also announce a roughly $32.5 billion acquisition of fellow rare disease drugmaker Baxalta International Inc as early as Monday, sources have told Reuters. The conference could also shed light on whether the sector can sustain its feverish deal-making pace.Healthcare stocks have gotten swept up in the broader market carnage that started 2016, with the S&P healthcare sector down 5.6 percent through Friday against a 6 percent slide for the S&P 500.Since 2000, healthcare has topped the S&P’s performance in seven of the past 10 Januarys, including the past three. The Nasdaq Biotechnology index has been even stronger, besting the S&P 500 in January in nine of the past 10 years, good for an average rise of 3.7 percent over that time against a 0.9 percent dip for stocks more broadly.Investors will be listening for guidance on how healthcare companies are approaching regulatory and political risks facing much of the healthcare sector.Pharmaceutical and biotech companies are likely to endure more criticism over pricing practices, especially as the 2016 presidential campaign heats up.“As an industry, we are looking at a potentially very significant political disruption this year, and I think there’s a risk factor that has to be compensated for,” said Brad McMillan, chief investment officer at Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Massachusetts. “It wouldn’t be an area I would overweight.”The outlook for the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama’s healthcare program known as Obamacare, will also be in focus after some hospital chains posted weak third-quarter results that suggested diminishing benefits from the program, and top insurer UnitedHealth Group said in November it might drop out of the individual insurance exchanges created under the ACA.“Getting a sense of what their outlook is for Q1 is going to be important,” said Bihag Patel, senior research analyst at Nuveen Asset Management in Minneapolis.

2016-10-01,"Regeneron eczema drug reduces itch and anxiety, two studies show",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1C52E2,"Oct 1 (Reuters) - Patients taking an experimental eczema drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi Inc experienced significant relief in itching and in anxiety and depression symptoms, meeting secondary goals of two large studies, researchers said on Saturday.Regeneron and Sanofi recently asked U.S. regulators to approve the injectable medicine, Dupixent (dupilumab), after it significantly cleared skin lesions in the same pair of studies without serious side effects typically seen with standard treatments for the chronic inflammatory skin disease. The studies involved a total of 1,400 adults with moderate to severe disease.“Reduction of itch intensity is important because itching is one of the most burdensome symptoms for patients and can impact other aspects of their lives, such as sleep,” said Dr. Eric Simpson, a dermatologist at Oregon Health & Science University who led the trials. He presented the new secondary data at the annual European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology Congress being held in Vienna.Researchers said significant reduction in patient-reported itch was seen two weeks, four weeks and 16 weeks after treatment began, based on the Pruritus Numerical Rating Scale, which ranks itch severity on a 0- to 10-point basis.At 16 weeks, a range of 36 to 41 percent of patients taking Dupixent either weekly or every two weeks reported a four-point or greater reduction in itch, compared with 10 to 12 percent of patients receiving placebos.Patients taking Dupixent also reported improvement in anxiety and depression symptoms, researchers said, meeting other secondary goals of the studies.Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, affects an estimated 2 percent of U.S. adults, and as many as 10 percent to 20 percent of children - the majority of cases being of mild to moderate severity.If cleared by regulators, Dupixent would be the first approved systemic treatment for eczema, which in severe cases produces infection-prone rashes and a constant itch as bad as poison ivy. Some analysts expect Dupixent to cost up to $30,000 a year and to capture eventual annual sales of more than $5 billion.The drug works by blocking IL-4 and IL-13, proteins that Regeneron believes to be underlying causes not only of eczema, but of other allergic conditions like asthma and nasal polyps for which the drug has shown favorable results in smaller Regeneron studies."

2016-10-17,FDA places Regeneron and Teva\'s pain-drug study on hold,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN12H17N,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and partner Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd said the U.S. health regulator placed a clinical hold on a study testing their pain treatment, dealing another blow to companies looking to develop a safer alternative to opioid painkillers.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) imposed the hold in the mid-stage trial in patients with chronic lower back pain, after a form of joint damage was observed in an advanced osteoarthritis patient who was given a high dose of the injectable drug, fasinumab.Monday’s announcement suggests fasinumab will be plagued by the same limitations as other drugs in its class, including heightened scrutiny, repeated delays, and labeling restrictions, Leerink Partners’ Geoffrey Porges said.The brokerage reduced its probability of success for the drug to zero, and cut Regeneron’s price target to $513 from $530.The treatment is designed to block nerve growth factor (NGF), a protein involved in transmission of pain signals.Fasinumab has the potential to be an alternative to prescription opioids, that are effective for pain relief but are associated with high rates of addiction, overdose and death.Following the FDA decision, Regeneron has completed an unplanned interim review of data and has stopped dosing patients, the companies said.The analysis showed clear evidence of an improvement in pain scores in patients dosed with fasinumab, compared with placebo.Regeneron was “lucky” to sell half the drug to Teva in a timely fashion,” noted Sanford C. Bernstein’s Ronny Gal.The news of the hold comes less than a month after Regeneron announced the up to $1.3 billion deal with Teva to co-develop fasinumab.The two drugmakers now plan to discuss with the FDA a late-stage study for chronic lower back pain, excluding patients with advanced osteoarthritis.Fasinumab is also being tested for use in osteoarthritis-related pain.Rival drugmakers Eli Lilly and Co and Pfizer Inc plan by 2018 to seek approval for their similar treatment, tanezumab, which is being tested as part of a $1.8 billion collaboration.Regeneron has been attempting for years to develop an anti-NGF drug for pain, but has been stymied by safety concerns.The FDA had placed fasinumab and other experimental agents targeting NGF on partial clinical hold in late 2012, after reports that animals on the drugs had suffered nerve damage.The hold has since been lifted."

The FDA did not cite any safety concerns in its notice to the drugmakers, called a complete response letter, the companies said.Sarilumab, meant for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, works by blocking a protein called IL-6 that is associated with inflammation. The companies had been expecting the FDA to make a decision on the injectable treatment by Oct. 30.In a large clinical trial of rheumatoid arthritis patients who had failed to benefit from the standard treatment methotrexate, sarilumab was shown to be superior to AbbVie Inc’s top-selling Humira in improving signs and symptoms of disease.Other IL-6 inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis include Roche Holding AG’s approved Actemra and Johnson & Johnson’s experimental sirukumab, now awaiting FDA approval.Regeneron shares, which had been halted ahead of the drugmakers’ announcement, were down 2.8 percent after trading resumed late Friday."

2016-11-01,"Pfizer cholesterol drug fizzles, hitting shares",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN12W3S8,"(Reuters) - Pfizer Inc PFE.N scrapped its high-profile cholesterol fighter after its effectiveness waned over time in large clinical trials, sending its shares 2 percent lower and prompting the company to trim its 2016 earnings forecast.The largest U.S. drugmaker trimmed the top end of its 2016 profit estimate on Tuesday, citing costs of scrapping the experimental injectable medicine, called bococizumab, which works by blocking the PCSK9 protein.Pfizer said bococizumab gradually lost its potency in reducing “bad” LDL cholesterol and caused more irritation at the injection site than similar recently approved drugs.Pfizer has been trying to catch up with two rival drugs approved by U.S. regulators more than a year ago. Repatha, from Amgen Inc AMGN.O, and Praluent, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O and Sanofi SA SASY.PA, can slash LDL cholesterol almost 60 percent, more effectively than traditional statins like Pfizer's Lipitor.But large ongoing trials have not yet determined whether they could actually reduce heart attacks.Chief Executive Ian Read said in an interview that the effectiveness of Pfizer’s drug waned in a significant number of patients after 52 weeks of treatment, which was surprising given the drug’s “robust” effectiveness at 12 weeks and 24 weeks.“The product looked great until we got the 52-week data,” Read said.Pfizer wants to become a bigger force in heart medicine by developing other experimental treatments but has no plans to pursue another PCSK9 inhibitor, Read added.Edward Jones analyst Ashtyn Evans said she had expected annual bococizumab sales of $500 million by 2020 and was disappointed that the drug’s waning effectiveness did not become apparent until costly Phase III studies were almost complete.She said Pfizer’s stock price of 12 times the company’s expected earnings per share for 2017 lagged the drug sector and that successful new products were needed to bring it into parity. The stock closed 64 cents lower at $31.07.Repatha and Praluent each have annual sales of only about $100 million, far below initial expectations. Insurers have blocked reimbursements largely because each treatment costs more than $14,000 a year.At the American Heart Association’s annual Scientific Sessions in New Orleans later this month, Amgen will present data on Repatha’s ability to reduce artery-clogging plaque. The company has said that the drug succeeded as measured by ultrasound pictures of the inside of arteries.Details of the magnitude of plaque reduction and just how clinically meaningful that might be is slated to be discussed at the annual sessions. Arterial plaque is considered one of the underlying causes of heart attacks and heart disease.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt said Pfizer's decision was good news for the PCSK9 program being conducted by The Medicines Co MDCO.O.“There is one fewer competitor and any big biopharma looking for an LDL cholesterol lowering program should want MDCO’s PCSK9si,” Butt said. That drug, currently in Phase III testing, works in a different way than the approved drugs by Amgen and Regeneron and may be administered quarterly or only twice a year.The Medcines Co’s shares rose 3.1 percent to close at $33.97. Pfizer cut the upper end of its 2016 earnings forecast to $2.43 per share from $2.48 while retaining the lower end at $2.38.The drugmaker, which in September decided not to split itself into two, said it earned 61 cents per share in the third quarter, excluding special items. The results missed the analysts’ average estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Quarterly sales of $13.05 billion matched Wall Street expectations.Sales of Ibrance, one of Pfizer's most important new drugs, totaled $550 million, trailing forecasts of $576 million. The breast cancer treatment, which has a list price of about $10,000 a month and blocks the CDK-4 and CDK-6 enzymes, faces looming competition from similar medicines being developed by Novartis AG NOVN.S and Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N. Pfizer raised the lower end of its full-year revenue forecast to $52 billion from $51 billion, while keeping the upper end at $53 billion."
2016-11-01,Drugmaker Sanofi hungry for deals after earnings beat,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN12S0EZ,"((This October 28 story has been corrected to fix spelling of Eli Lilly in sixth paragraph.))(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi stepped up its overhaul on Friday, putting its European generic drugs business up for sale and saying that a planned 3.5 billion euro ($3.8 billion) share buyback would not suppress its appetite for deals.Sanofi’s announcement came as it posted better than expected earnings and lifted its profit guidance for the year on strong growth at its biotech arm Genzyme and an early start to the U.S. flu vaccine season.Third-quarter net income adjusted for special items rose 9.7 percent to 2.3 billion euros, against analyst expectations of about 2 billion euros. Revenue rose 2.1 percent to 9.65 billion euros, also beating the market view.Sanofi now expects 2016 adjusted earnings per share to grow by 3 percent to 5 percent at constant exchange rates, having previously said they would be broadly flat. It continues to predict a negative 4 percent currency impact.Sanofi stuck to its guidance for currency-adjusted sales at its embattled diabetes division to shrink by 4-8 percent a year on average from 2015 to 2018, saying that business outside the United States was holding up.Pressure on U.S. operations has been rising after U.S. pharmacy benefit manager CVS and medical insurer UnitedHealth Group recently took steps to replace Sanofi’s main insulin drug Lantus for a cheaper Eli Lilly product.The shares jumped 5.9 percent to 72.90 euros at 0759 GMT, their highest in more than two months.Analysts at Bryan Garnier and Deutsche Bank pointed to strong vaccine sales and good management of operating costs, while Berenberg analysts said it was reassuring to see Sanofi contain the decline in diabetes drug revenue.Sanofi, which was trumped in August by Pfizer’s $14 billion bid for U.S. cancer drug company Medivation, said the share buyback was mainly prompted by excess cash from an asset swap with Boehringer and did not constitute a retreat from the merger and acquisitions market.The company stands to receive 4.7 billion euros from the Boehringer deal signed in June.CEO Olivier Brandicourt pointed to low debt levels and borrowing costs as well as strong cash flow.“All of that will allow us to still act swiftly if attractive opportunities arise,” he said in a conference call.Quarterly sales at Genzyme grew 16.9 percent to 1.27 billion euros while the Sanofi Pasteur vaccines business lifted revenue by 14.4 percent to 1.8 billion euros, both adjusted for currency swings. Sales at the diabetes division were down 2.5 percent.Along with the veterinary drugs business that Sanofi will transfer to Germany’s Boehringer, the French group will also divest its European generic drugs business, which had sales of about 800 million euros in 2015.Finance chief Jerome said profitability of the asset for sale, which excludes generic drugs in Russia, CIS and Turkey, is “not very far” from the group average, without elaborating.The business requires investment in areas, such as complex generics, that Sanofi is not ready to make, he added.In a setback for its experimental rheumatoid arthritis drug sarilumab, which analysts expect to generate more than 500 million euros in annual sales, U.S. regulators identified “manufacturing deficiencies”.Sanofi said it is unclear whether this will hobble the approval process for sarilumab, which Sanofi develops with U.S. biotech company Regeneron."
2016-11-04,Regeneron profit tops Street on lower costs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N1D53LI,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc's REGN.O quarterly profit handsomely beat estimates, helped by lower costs and a smaller tax bill, even as sales growth of its flagship drug Eylea continued to slow.Eylea sales, which have powered Regeneron’s explosive growth since late 2011, have been slowing in recent quarters, raising concerns about the U.S. biotechnology company’s prospects.U.S. Eylea sales rose 16 percent to $854 million in the third quarter ended Sept. 30, in line with analysts’ expectations.However, sales growth slowed from 27 percent in the second quarter and 44 percent in the first quarter.Regeneron is facing discounts and rebates from Eylea competitors, Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said on a conference call.The drug, which treats macular degeneration among other eye disorders, competes with Roche Holding AG's ROG.S Avastin and Novartis AG's NOVN.S Lucentis.Eylea is being tested as a monotherapy and in combination with other drugs for various eye conditions.Sales will grow as the American population ages, and as the eye drug wins other approvals, company executives said.Sales of Regeneron and Sanofi SA's SASY.PA potent, but expensive, new cholesterol fighter Praluent jumped to $38 million from $4 million a year earlier, missing the average estimate of $40.5 million. The drug and Amgen Inc's AMGN.O rival drug Repatha are expected to rake in billions but have so far generated tepid sales as health insurers wait for evidence that they can reduce heart attacks before agreeing to pay for them.Regeneron on Friday said a second interim analysis of data from its ongoing cardiovascular study is expected by the end of November. Depending on the outcome, the study could be stopped either for futility or overwhelming efficacy.Regeneron and Sanofi’s arthritis treatment, sarilumab, was rejected last week by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, over manufacturing deficiencies.It is too early to forecast a timeline for approval, Schleifer said, and indicated that Regeneron is looking to launch the drug at a price that insurers “will find attractive.”Excluding items, Regeneron earned $3.13 per share, beating the average analysts’ estimate of $2.71 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue, which also includes collaboration revenue from partners Sanofi and Bayer BAYGn.DE, rose 7.3 percent to $1.22 billion, missing the average estimate of $1.29 billion, due to lower collaboration revenue.Regeneron bumped up the lower end of its full-year sales growth forecast for Eylea. It now expects the drug’s sales to grow 23 percent-25 percent from 20 percent-25 percent.Shares of the company reversed course to trade up as much as 4.68 percent at $351.74."

2016-11-04,S&P 500 losing streak extends to ninth straight day,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN12Z1CD,"(Reuters) - The S&P 500 ended lower on Friday for a ninth straight day, the longest losing streak for the benchmark index in more than 35 years, as investors stayed on edge ahead of an uncertain U.S. election.The tech-heavy Nasdaq also ended lower for a ninth-consecutive session, while the Dow industrials closed down for a seventh straight day.Investors have been unnerved by signs of a tightening presidential race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump.Clinton had been thought to have a clear lead until the re-emergence last week of a controversy over her use of a private email server while secretary of state.“Investors are uncertain about the outcome of the election, and they have grown more uncertain since last Friday,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in Greenwood, South Carolina.The Dow Jones industrial average .DJI fell 42.39 points, or 0.24 percent, to 17,888.28, the S&P 500 .SPX lost 3.48 points, or 0.17 percent, to 2,085.18 and the Nasdaq Composite .IXIC dropped 12.04 points, or 0.24 percent, to 5,046.37.Despite the historic run, the S&P has pulled back by only about 3.1 percent over that time. For the year, the index is up 2 percent.It was the 14th time since 1928 that the S&P 500 had declined for nine sessions in a row, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices.On Friday, Wall Street had posted solid gains as of the afternoon, spurred by a strong U.S. employment report, but then lost steam and sold off into the close.“Obviously the big concern this week has been the shift in the polls in the election. We did have a bounce for a period of time, but when it didn’t hold and people just decided to liquidate going into the close to reduce exposure in case any more news hits over the weekend,” said Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Greenwich, Connecticut.“There’s a lot of headline risk out there.”U.S. employers maintained a strong pace of hiring in October and boosted wages for workers, the Labor Department reported on Friday. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 161,000 jobs last month amid gains in construction, healthcare and professional and business services.While that was below economists’ forecast for growth of 175,000 jobs, solid labor market fundamentals were underscored by revisions to August and September data, which showed 44,000 more jobs created than previously reported.“The upward revisions over the last two months suggest that the overall picture is continued job growth,” said Kate Warne, investment strategist with Edward Jones in St. Louis. “That means that consumers have more money and that should continue to support economic growth.”Higher-than-expected quarterly profits from biotech company Regeneron REGN.O and health insurer Humana HUM.N lifted those companies' shares, along with the S&P healthcare sector .SPXHC, which rose 0.8 percent on Friday.Consumer staples .SPLRCS were the worst-performing group, falling 1 percent.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 1.06-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.09-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 4 new 52-week highs and 15 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 32 new highs and 148 new lows.About 7.3 billion shares changed hands on U.S. exchanges, above the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions."

2016-11-15,Long-lasting cholesterol lowering seen with Medicines Co drug: study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN13A28N,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - A new type of heart drug developed by Medicines Co significantly lowered “bad” LDL cholesterol in high-risk patients with no major safety issues, according to data from a midstage trial that helped the company identify the dose it will move into advanced testing.The drug, now called inclisiran, belongs to a new class of drugs that inhibit a protein known as PCSK9, which prevents the removal of LDL from the blood. But the Medicines Co drug works in a different way than the two already on the market and is given far less frequently, an important potential commercial difference if it eventually wins approval.The study tested several strengths of inclisiran against a placebo in about 500 patients, many of whom had had a prior heart attack or stroke. All had high LDL levels despite most being on high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins.The study found 300 milligrams to be the minimum dose to achieve maximum efficacy, having shown itself to lower LDL about as much as the 500 mg strength. That is the dose that will be used in larger Phase III trials aimed at winning regulatory approval, the company said.One 300 mg dose of inclisiran led to an average lowering of LDL by 51 percent at Day 60, which was maintained over three months. Two 300 mg injections given on Day 1 and Day 90 on average took LDL down by 57 percent at Day 120, and maintained its effectiveness over six months.The data indicates the drug “is likely to ensure significant and durable reductions in LDL cholesterol and could potentially impact cardiovascular outcomes,” said Dr. Kausik Ray, who presented the data at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday.Dr. Borge Nordestgaard, who was not involved in the study, called the data “really, really encouraging.”Only 189 patients were available for evaluation at 180 days. Six-month data for all patients is expected by year-end.Inclisiran is designed to be taken just twice or three times a year. Amgen Inc’s Repatha and Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA are injected either every two or four weeks.Those drugs are antibodies that block PCSK9 from doing its job in the blood.

2016-11-15,Amgen cholesterol drug reduces artery-clogging plaque in study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1DE0KE,"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s potent new drug Repatha, when added to statin therapy, not only took “bad” LDL cholesterol down to extremely low levels but caused declines in artery-clogging plaque in a majority of high-risk heart patients after 18 months of treatment, according to data from a clinical trial.Amgen had previously announced the study was a success. But the percentage of patients who experienced a decrease of the substance that is the underlying cause of heart disease and magnitude of plaque regression was revealed at the American Heart Association scientific meeting in New Orleans on Tuesday.The 968-patient trial compared the effect of monthly injections with Repatha plus a cholesterol-lowering statin with statins alone on the plaques that can break off and cause heart attacks. The plaque measurements were collected with an ultrasound probe placed inside the diseased artery.Patients in the study had symptomatic heart disease and blockages of 20 percent to 50 percent in the tested artery.“We saw profound regression,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at Cleveland Clinic who presented the data.The combination therapy led to a further 60 percent reduction in LDL levels beyond statins alone to an average LDL of a mere 36.6. That translated into a decrease in percent of blockage volume of about 1 percent compared with no change for statins alone.In all, 64.3 percent on the combination therapy experienced plaque regression compared with 52.7 percent with statin monotherapy.“We didn’t know what would happen to disease progression at LDL cholesterol levels when we go to below about 60,” Nissen explained.For those who began the trial with LDL below 70, the lowest target guideline for high risk patients, 81 percent experienced coronary plaque regression with the addition of Repatha compared with 48 percent for statins alone. Those Repatha patients on average saw LDL levels drop to 24 with a low of about 15.“That’s unbelievable. So when you get down to 24 you’ve got a really high chance of your plaques melting away,” Nissen said.Repatha and Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi belong to an expensive new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors. They carry a list price of more than $14,000 a year before discounts and rebates.Many heart doctors have been upset by barriers to access to these drugs they encounter from health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, even for their sickest patients who meet all the criteria mandated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.More than 100,000 prescriptions have been written for Repatha in the United States since its approval, but two-thirds of patients are ultimately denied, Amgen said.“It’s crazy what’s going on. They’ve basically destroyed our capacity to treat our patients with the drugs that we need to treat them with,” said Dr. Seth Baum, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology.In the third quarter, Repatha had anemic sales of just $40 million, while Praluent took in $38 million for drugs forecast to be multibillion-dollar products.It is widely believed that payers will not lift reimbursement restrictions until they see results from huge studies designed to show that the new medicines cut the risk of heart attacks and death in addition to their ability to slash LDL levels. The Repatha outcomes data is expected in early 2017.But the plaque regression data unveiled on Tuesday is likely a strong indictor that those trials will be positive.“These findings suggest that the large clinical outcome trials currently underway are likely to show major benefits,” said Dr. Stephen Nicholls, one of the study’s lead directors."

2016-11-16,Janus portfolio manager sees more biotech gains on Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN13B2I4,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Biotech stocks still have room to rise after the election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, which removed threats of drug price controls that had pushed shares to historically cheap levels this year, a top portfolio manager for Janus said on Wednesday.The Nasdaq Biotechnology index .NBI has climbed 11 percent since the election, but still remains down 14 percent for 2016. Given the deregulation of healthcare signaled by Donald Trump, who was elected last week in a surprise victory, that is not enough, according to Janus Global Life Sciences co-portfolio manager Ethan Lovell.The election, including Republicans retaining control of Congress, has removed the threat of Hillary Clinton’s agenda on drug pricing.If Trump follows through on promises to overturn the current administration’s executive orders, it will lessen regulations, Lovell said.“Whether you like Trump or not, that is fantastic news for what has become a very, very burdened industry in healthcare,” he said.Lovell expects Trump to start working on turning back the Affordable Care Act as soon as he takes office in January.In a significant example of a potential benefit for biotech and pharmaceutical companies, he expects Trump to strike the authority of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to impose spending controls on Medicare under certain circumstances.President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare law includes a clause to review and clamp down on Medicare spending either through the creation of an oversight board or by giving the Secretary of Health and Human Services direct power to do so. Many investors had expected that clause to be triggered in 2017 based on the pace of Medicare spending increases reported earlier this year.Drug companies that have been holding back on price increases because of the current regulatory environment may well have more room to implement price increases in the second half of next year, he said.Among companies that he said were facing the overhang of drug pricing regulation through the Medicare program and whose shares could rise are Celgene Corp CELG.O, little changed this year, and Regeneron REGN.O, off 22 percent in 2016.Also, the ability for companies to set prices on their new drugs more freely in a deregulated environment as well as raise prices at least modestly could make dealmaking more viable than under Clinton, he said."

Praluent could still prove itself at the final stage, when more data will have been amassed.The treatment belongs to a new class of medicines targeting the PCSK9 protein that maintains LDL cholesterol in the bloodstream.

2016-12-01,Pharma executives weigh in on possible changes under Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN13Q5M5,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Top executives from large U.S. drugmakers on Thursday discussed for the first time possible changes for the industry under President-elect Donald Trump, and issues that have damaged the reputation of their industry.Since he was elected, Trump, who has said he wants to repeal Obamacare and reform Medicare and Medicaid, has not addressed the sharp drug price increases that dominated the Presidential campaign.Pharma companies are breathing a sigh of relief, but Trump could be more critical of drugmakers and their price increases than the industry expects, Allergan Inc Chief Executive Brent Saunders said on Thursday.Saunders, speaking at the annual Forbes Healthcare Summit in New York, predicted Trump could be a “more vicious tweeter” against the drug industry than his former Democratic rival Hillary Clinton had been during the campaign.Clinton’s tweets committing to a crackdown on exorbitant drug price increases weighed heavily on pharmaceutical shares since her first tweet in September 2015. Pharma shares jumped in the days after Trump’s election as Clinton’s proposed price controls fell off the table.Saunders said Americans are rightly angry about price increases, and the industry needs to police itself or face government repercussions.“I worry today that the pharmaceutical industry has a very false sense of security because of the Trump administration and a Republican-controlled Congress,” Saunders said.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals CEO Len Schleifer, speaking on a panel at the Forbes conference, said the industry will be seen in a bad light as long as it maintains the common practice of taking twice yearly, often double-digit, price increases on widely-used medicines.“We as an industry have used price increases to fill gaps in innovation,” he said.“You can’t say ‘I set the price based on the value of the drug’ and then have these egregious price increases,” Schleifer said, adding that the value of a drug to society does not increase each year.Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read took exception to Schleifer’s characterization of the price hikes, arguing the cost of prescription drugs as a percentage of overall healthcare spending had not changed in two decades.In an overhauled U.S. healthcare plan under Trump, Read said he would like to see financial risk shift from insurers to providers, such as hospitals, with an emphasis on prevention and wellness.“Give them the tools and the freedom and the incentive to manage that risk,” Read said.Separately, Merck & Co CEO Ken Frazier said he thought one of Trump’s proposed healthcare reform policies - allowing the import of cheaper drugs from other countries - will not work. The U.S. pays more than any other country for medicines, and current U.S. law forbids importation of drugs from other countries that charge far less.“I don’t think it’s going to be made possible,” said Frazier, during an interview on CNBC after an appearance at the conference. “Every time we’ve tried to do that no FDA commissioner has ever been willing to certify the safety of those drugs.”"

2016-12-12,Novartis eye drug franchise hit by failed Fovista studies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1410NQ,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s bid to bolster its eye drug portfolio suffered a setback on Monday when it announced combining Lucentis with Fovista in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) did not produce better outcomes than treatment with Lucentis alone.Two phase III studies that combined Ophthotech’s Fovista with Lucentis “did not meet the primary endpoint of superiority”, Novartis said in a statement.Two years ago, the Swiss drugmaker signed a potential $1 billion licensing deal with Ophthotech to market Fovista outside the United States.It had hoped a successful combination with Lucentis could help it counter waning sales of Lucentis, which has been hurt by competition from other drugs.With the trials’ failure, however, Novartis said it still hoped analysis of underlying data would provide further understanding and guidance on helping nAMD patients.“The proven efficacy of Lucentis monotherapy was not improved by the addition of” Fovista, said Vasant Narasimhan, Novartis’s chief drug development officer. “Together with Ophthotech we continue to analyze the data.”Novartis shares slipped 0.3 percent in early trading.Age-related macular degeneration affects up to 25 million people worldwide and is the leading cause of early blindness in the industrial world.In the first nine months of 2016, Lucentis’s sales for Novartis outside the United States fell 11 percent, on top of a previous decline in 2015, due to competition from drugs including Regeneron’s Eylea.“A positive result of the study would have been welcome to add a little pep to waning Lucentis sales,” wrote Michael Nawrath, a Zuercher Kantonal Bank analyst, in a note. “For the small company Ophthotech this will be much worse than for Novartis, but it’s still a negative result.”The failure leaves Novartis hoping for more-favorable results from a separate phase III trial of its investigational medication RTH258 against nAMD, due to be published early next year.The failure also impacts Roche, which has marketing rights for Lucentis in the United States and had a deal with Novartis for a share of revenue from Fovista outside the United States."

2016-12-13,"As drug approvals dive in 2016, returns on R&D deteriorate",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1421DN,"LONDON (Reuters) - The global pharmaceuticals industry is set to win the lowest annual number of new drug approvals this year since 2010 and a new report on Tuesday suggests drugmakers’ returns on research investment are deteriorating.Only 19 new drugs have been approved in the key U.S. market so far in 2016 and, with less than three weeks to go, it is clear the full-year tally will be well down on 2015 and 2014’s bumper haul of 45 and 41 new products respectively.At the same time the profitability of drug research is being squeezed by steadily rising costs and increasing political pressure over the high prices of many modern medicines.As a result projected returns on investment in research and development (R&D) for the top 12 pharmaceutical companies have fallen to just 3.7 percent this year from a high of 10.1 percent in 2010, according to consultancy Deloitte.“The majority of companies are struggling to achieve historical peak sales,” said Colin Terry, a director in Deloitte’s life sciences practice.“As costs per product remain high, sales projections decline, and given it now takes the industry over 14 years to launch a drug, real questions should be raised about productivity and returns on innovation.”Deloitte’s annual report calculates the return on investment that leading drug companies can expect based on long-term sales forecasts.Many industry executives still remain upbeat about finding new medicines, given advances in understanding the genetic basis of a wide range of diseases. However, they acknowledge the peak approval rates seen in 2014 and 2015 were exceptional.An increasing number of new treatments are being targeted at niche patient populations and are designed for rare diseases or very specific sub-types of cancer.With a few more drugs still expected to win a green light from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this month, including Roche’s closely watched multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus, Deutsche Bank analysts believe the final total of new approvals for 2016 will be around 22.That is well below the 2005-2015 average of 28 but next year there could be a rebound, given the industry’s promising development pipeline. Some products that were delayed in 2016, such as Sanofi and Regeneron’s sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis, could also get a green light.As a result, Deutsche sees potential for a 2017 new drug tally of 37 - and the industry could receive a boost if FDA reform speeds up the approval process.The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has also waved through fewer new products this year, recommending a total of 73 new medicines in the first 11 months of 2016 against a 2015 total of 93. Unlike the FDA, the EMA includes generic drugs in its list."
2016-12-14,FDA approves Pfizer ointment for chronic itchy skin condition,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N1E94N7,"(Reuters) - A Pfizer Inc PFE.N ointment to treat mild to moderate cases of the itchy skin condition eczema, or atopic dermatitis, won U.S. approval for use in patients aged two years and older, the Food and Drug Administration said on Wednesday. Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is the most common of the many types of eczema, typically beginning in childhood and possibly lasting through adulthood. The condition causes red, scaly and crusted bumps on the skin that can be extremely itchy.The topical drug, crisaborole, will be sold under the brand name Eucrisa, the FDA said.Pfizer, which acquired the drug through its $5.2 billion purchase of Anacor Pharmaceuticals earlier this year, has estimated potential annual peak sales for Eucrisa of about $2 billion.Eucrisa will carry a wholesale price of $580 for a 60 gram (2 ounce) tube and be available by the end of January, Pfizer said. The wholesale cost does not take into account discounts or rebates the company may offer insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.Atopic dermatitis is considered to be a large market and an unmet need.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O and Sanofi SASY.PA are awaiting an approval decision for their injectable drug dupilumab for more severe cases of atopic dermatitis, which patients have described as being like having a permanent case of poison ivy that leads to intense scratching and skin damage.While dupilumab appears to be more effective, BMO Capital Markets analyst Alex Arfaei said in a research note, “Eucrisa will likely have a dosing, safety and price advantage; attractive attributes for dermatologists.”He sees the treatment reaching annual peak sales of about $2 billion by 2023.In clinical trials that led to the drug’s approval, many patients who received Eucrisa experienced clear or almost clear skin after 28 days of treatment. The most common side effect was application site pain, including burning or stinging, the agency said.Pfizer shares were little changed, closing at $32.82 on the New York Stock Exchange."

2016-2-08,UK cost agency rebuffs Sanofi cholesterol drug but backs Amgen\'s,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0VH1F6,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s cost watchdog has recommended that patients with high cholesterol should not get Sanofi and Regeneron’s new cholesterol-lowering injection Praluent, although Amgen’s similar drug Repatha will be available.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) cost watchdog said in draft guidance on Monday that Praluent’s benefits were uncertain and it was likely to overshoot standard cost-effectiveness thresholds.NICE, which decides if drugs should be used on the state health service, had initially reached a similar decision for Amgen’s product in November.But in a change of heart on Friday it said Repatha could be an option for some patients, provided it was supplied at an agreed - but undisclosed - price discount.Both Praluent and Repatha belong to a potent new class of drugs known as PCSK9 inhibitors that have proved highly effective at lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol."
2016-2-09,Regeneron sees gradual adoption of cholesterol drug Praluent,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0VI16Y,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales for its new cholesterol drug and reiterated expectations of a ""gradual uptake"" for the treatment, which has been tipped to be its next blockbuster.Regeneron’s shares fell as much as 10 percent after the drugmaker also forecast slowing sales growth for its blockbuster eye drug, Eylea, this year.Sales of cholesterol-lowering Praluent, which was approved in July, were $7 million in the fourth quarter, missing the average estimate of $23 million, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov.The drug, which had a month's lead over rival drug Repatha from Amgen Inc AMGN.O, is approved to treat people at higher risk of cardiovascular diseases with higher cholesterol levels.“We continue to expect a gradual uptake,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said on a conference call.However, Leerink Partners analysts said Praluent’s slow start will weigh on long-term revenue expectations.Praluent sales are being recorded by the company's development partner, French drugmaker Sanofi SA SNY.N. Regeneron shares in any profits or losses from its commercialization.Regeneron said it expected full-year sales of Eylea to increase by about 20 percent in the United States, compared with a 54 percent rise in 2015. The drug raked in sales of $2.68 billion in 2015.The eye drug’s success has been responsible for the company’s explosive growth since November 2011, when it was approved to treat wet age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness in the elderly.The reality of slowing Eylea growth ... is likely to pressure the stock, Morgan Stanley analyst Matthew Harrison said.The company, which reported a lower-than-expected profit for the first time in four quarters, said net income rose 72 percent to $155 million, or $1.34 per share, in the quarter ended Dec. 31.On an adjusted basis, the company earned $2.83 per share, missing analysts’ average estimate of $3.36 per share, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose 37 percent to $1.10 billion, short of the average estimate of $1.17 billion.Eylea sales in the United States rose 44 percent to $746 million in the quarter, missing the average forecast of $752 million compiled by Evercore ISI.Regeneron’s shares were down 5.3 percent at $369.91 in late morning trade on the Nasdaq on Tuesday. The stock had fallen about 28 percent since the start of the year up to Monday’s close."

2016-2-12,Express Scripts sees slow 2016 sales for new cholesterol drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N15R1H9,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - A surge in sales of pricey new cholesterol treatments is unlikely to materialize this year, contrary to the previous expectations of Express Scripts Holding, an executive from the largest manager of U.S. drug benefits said on Friday.Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller, who last year warned about the drugs’ potential cost, said his company miscalculated how many cardiologists would prescribe the potent medicines, which were approved last summer.The new drugs, one from Amgen and another from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals in partnership with Sanofi , slash “bad” LDL cholesterol by blocking the protein PCSK9. They were approved for a small population of patients with extremely high LDL.Express Scripts and rival CVS Health warned last year that using a wider group of patients would place too large a cost burden on the healthcare system. The drugs are priced at more than $14,000 per year, before discounts, compared with a few hundred dollars per year for statins, the standard cholesterol treatments.Amgen did not disclose fourth-quarter Repatha sales, saying they had not been material, but said it expects growth in 2016. Regeneron earlier this week reported fourth-quarter Praluent sales of just $7 million.“We believe that the net sales in the 4th quarter understates actual physician and patient demand,” Regeneron spokeswoman Arleen Goldenberg said in an email.Express Scripts expects the slow take-off to continue this year, in part because doctors have not been prescribing the medicines at the rate it was expecting.The companies have said sales were affected by issues with insurers, who were slow to cover the drugs. Meanwhile, the drugmakers have been providing free product to patients.“Cardiologists are waiting for health outcomes data,” Miller said in an interview in New York, referring to large clinical trials to determine how much the drugs reduce the risk of heart attacks and death. Interim results are due later this year.P.K. Shah, a cardiologist with Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, said many doctors are reluctant to prescribe the new drugs because of costs and lack of definitive data yet showing they prevent heart attacksAnother top cardiologist cited road blocks placed by pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers.“The barriers the PBMs have set up to getting patients on PCSK9 inhibitors are the reason sales have been slow,” said Dr. Steven Nissen, head of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic.CVS Health Chief Medical Officer Troyen Brennan declined to comment on PCSK9 sales, but said its cost management in the category has been effective."

To maintain bull market status, the index would have to surpass that high and keep climbing. If, instead, it goes down 20 percent from that high, that date will be seen as the official end of the bull market.- Of the S&P’s 10 major sectors, the consumer discretionary one grew the most during the bull, surging about 378 percent.- Energy has lagged the most, growing only 43.1 percent.- Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O is the best performer of S&P components that have been in the index during the bull run, up more than 3,080 percent. On the downside, Southwestern Energy SWN.N, off about 74 percent, is the worst performing component. - This bull market will be 2,557 days on Wednesday.- It would have to last 2,608 days to make it the second-longest and 3,454 days to be the longest ever. The two longest bull markets ran from June 14, 1949 to August 2, 1956 and October 11, 1990 to March 24, 2000.- Other major indexes, the Dow Jones industrial average and Nasdaq Composite, grew about 159 percent and 266 percent, respectively.- Along with stocks, the job market has been on the incline, with an unemployment rate of 4.9 percent. In 2009, unemployment hovered around 8.7 pct.- One of the few things that hasn’t seemed to change since the start of the bull market are the pop charts, where seven years later, Flo Rida, is still near the top - this time with “Hello Friday”."

Wednesday’s market action extended that trend, with Brent crude rising above $40 a barrel, continuing its recovery from decade lows that led to stock market turmoil in January.“It’s still this puzzling correlation between the price of oil and stocks. It really is not supposed to play out this way,” said Jake Dollarhide, chief executive officer of Longbow Asset Management in Tulsa.“But given that oil drove the U.S. stock market down, it makes sense that stocks’ rise would be tied to oil’s comeback.”Since Feb. 11, the S&P 500 has gained 8.7 percent, repairing some of the damage caused by the S&P 500’s worst January since 2009.

2016-3-16,"Amgen beats Sanofi, Regeneron at cholesterol drug trial",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N16O1EX,"(Reuters) - A federal jury upheld the validity of two Amgen Inc patents related to the company’s newly-approved drug to reduce bad cholesterol, in a defeat for Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which make a rival drug.In a joint statement on Wednesday, Sanofi and Regeneron said they strongly disagreed with the verdict by jurors in Wilmington, Delaware upholding the validity of Amgen’s patents, which followed a weeklong trial.Damages have yet to be set. The defendants said they plan to appeal to the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviews patent disputes.In its October 2014 lawsuit, Amgen sought to stop Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron from selling Praluent, a drug intended to lower bad LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9.Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha, and said Praluent infringed the Thousand Oaks, California-based company’s patents related to the protein.Last summer, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Praluent and Repatha to reduce bad cholesterol.U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson, who presided over the trial, is expected to consider whether to issue a permanent injunction against the sale of Praluent.Sanofi and Regeneron said the verdict will not keep them from selling Praluent for now.But they may owe royalties to Amgen if the litigation, following any appeals, ultimately concludes in Amgen’s favor.Amgen in a statement said it was “thankful” for the verdict.The drugs are costlier than other treatments targeting bad cholesterol, with a list price topping $14,000 annually.Sales have been slow because insurers have resisted the cost, while many doctors are awaiting the results of clinical trials about whether the treatments also reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes.“A permanent injunction is unlikely,” Deutsche Bank analyst Tim Race said in a research note. “However, the likelihood of settlement has now increased substantially with Sanofi and its partner Regeneron potentially forced to pay royalties.”In afternoon trading, Amgen shares were up 70 cents at $143.91; Regeneron shares were down $2.83 at $364.39; and Sanofi’s American depositary shares were down 32 cents at $40.83."

2016-4-01,"Regeneron, Sanofi eczema drug clears hurdles in big trials",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0WY3KI,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi said on Friday their experimental treatment for eczema proved highly effective in two large studies, without serious side effects often seen with standard treatments for the chronic inflammatory skin disease.The drugmakers said they would seek U.S. approval this year for their injectable drug, dupilumab, based upon strong results in the trials involving almost 1,400 adults with moderate to severe disease.If cleared by regulators, it would be the first approved systemic treatment for the condition, which in severe cases produces infection-prone rashes over much of the body and a constant itch as bad as poison ivy.Some analysts expect dupilumab to cost up to $30,000 a year and to capture eventual annual sales of more than $5 billion.In the two identical Phase 3 studies, respectively, there was a clearing or near clearing of skin lesions among 37 percent and 36 percent of patients who received dupilumab weekly and 38 percent and 36 percent who received injections every two weeks.An average of roughly 70 percent improvement in rash area and eczema severity was seen among patients taking the drug in both trials, about twice the improvement seen among those receiving placebo.The rate of serious side effects, including infections, was less for dupilumab than for placebos.Dupilumab works by blocking IL-4 and IL-13, proteins Regeneron believe to be underlying causes not only of eczema, but of other allergic conditions like asthma and nasal polyps for which the drug has shown favorable results in smaller Regeneron studies.“If you look across our research programs, these two proteins appear to be key drivers of allergic responses in all these diseases,” George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s research chief, said in an interview.Eczema, also called atopic dermatitis, affects an estimated 2 percent of U.S. adults, and as many as 10 percent to 20 percent of children - the majority of cases being of mild to moderate severity.Regeneron is best known for its blockbuster Eylea treatment for macular degeneration, a leading cause of blindness, and recently won approval for a new type of cholesterol fighter.Current treatments for eczema include cyclosporine, an oral immune suppressant that is not approved for the condition and raises risks of infection and kidney problems. Topical steroid ointments are the mainstay of treatment, but also provide limited long-term relief and can cause worrisome side effects."

2016-4-05,Pfizer\'s Allergan deal teeters on new U.S. inversion curbs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1780QC,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. drug maker Pfizer Inc’s $160 billion agreement to acquire Botox maker Allergan Plc was on the brink of being abandoned on Tuesday, after the U.S. Treasury issued new rules on how tax “inversion” deals can be structured.Allergan’s shares were hit considerably hard on Tuesday, showing how the rules that were issued on Monday targeted the biggest inversion attempted to date. The federal government has grappled with a wave of recent inversions by U.S. companies seeking to slash their tax bills by redomiciling overseas in merger deals.Pfizer is now leaning towards abandoning the deal with Allergan, though no final decision has yet been made, a source familiar with the situation said. Were the deal to be tweaked, Pfizer is concerned U.S. President Barack Obama’s administration could change the rules again to thwart a deal, according to the source.Pfizer shares ended up 2 percent on hopes the company would walk away or renegotiate the deal in its favor. Allergan shares closed down 14.8 percent to their lowest level since October 2014.Obama on Tuesday called global tax avoidance a “huge problem” and urged Congress to take action to stop U.S. companies from tax-avoiding corporate “inversions”, which lower companies tax bills by redomiciling overseas.“While the Treasury Department’s actions will make it more difficult... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole, only Congress can close it for good,” Obama said.Several U.S. presidential candidates, including Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, have seized on the issue in their campaigns.“We have so many companies leaving, it is disgraceful,” Trump told reporters as he greeted voters in Waukesha, Wisconsin on Tuesday. Clinton and Sanders both expressed support for Treasury’s plan.Besides Pfizer-Allergan, other pending inversion deals that have not yet closed include the proposed $16.5 billion merger of Johnson Controls Inc with Ireland-based Tyco International Plc, Waste Connections Inc’s $2.67 billion deal with Canada’s Progressive Waste Solutions Ltd , and IHS Inc’s $13 billion acquisition of London-based Markit Ltd.In all these cases, the shares of the target companies fell only slightly. Johnson Controls and Tyco said they would respond after conducting a review of the new rules.Waste Connections and Progressive Waste Solutions said they expected the rules would impact less than 3 percent of the combined adjusted free cash flow in their first year after the deal.IHS and Markit said they believed the rules would not affect their adjusted effective tax rate guidance of a low to mid-twenties percentage range.Under previous rules which still apply, Allergan shareholders need to own at least 40 percent of the combined company for the two companies to enjoy the full tax benefits of an inversion, and more than 20 percent to have any inversion benefit at all.But a new ‘three-year-look-back rule’ issued by the Treasury on Monday makes this much harder for Allergan, and appeared to take aim directly at it because of how the company was put together.The new rule does not allow stock accumulated through the foreign company’s U.S. deals in the last three years to count towards the book value needed to meet the inversion threshold.This weighs on Allergan heavily because of its significant deals in this timeframe. These include the $66 billion merger of Allergan and Actavis Plc, the $25 billion purchase of Forest Laboratories and the $5 billion takeover of Warner Chilcott.“The serial acquisition portion of the regulations will cause Pfizer to be treated as an ‘expatriated entity’ (under the terms of its existing deal with Allergan),” Robert Willens, a corporate tax and accounting analyst, wrote in a note.In a second change to the rules, the Treasury also said it would seek to limit a practice known as earnings stripping that is often undertaken following, but not limited to, an inversion. The new Treasury rules would restrict related-party debt for U.S. subsidiaries in dealings that do not finance new investment in the United States.If Pfizer does not acquire Allergan’s new, fast-growing medicines, Pfizer would need to look for other companies with attractive products, such as U.S. drugmakers Biogen Inc , Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and AbbVie Inc , said Raghuram Selvaraju, managing director of brokerage H.C. Wainwright.Pfizer had planned to make a decision by 2016 whether to split off its hundreds of generic medicines, but delayed the decision until 2019 after announcing its merger with Allergan. Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said the decision could be moved to late 2017 or 2018 if the deal with Allergan collapses.Pfizer, which announced the deal in November, has said its tax rate would drop to about 17 or 18 percent after the deal, from around 25 percent. That would represent more than $1 billion in annual cost savings."

2016-4-21,AstraZeneca taps gene pioneer Venter for huge drug-hunting sweep,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N17O7FC,"CAMBRIDGE, England (Reuters) - AstraZeneca, working with genome pioneer Craig Venter, is launching a massive gene hunt in the most comprehensive bet yet by a pharmaceutical firm on the potential of genetic variations to unlock routes to new medicines.The initiative, announced on Friday, involves sequencing up to 2 million human genomes - the complete set of genetic code that acts as the software of life - including 500,000 DNA samples collected by AstraZeneca in global clinical trials.Financial details of the 10-year project were not disclosed but Mene Pangalos, head of early drug development, said the company would be investing “hundreds of millions of dollars”.AstraZeneca aims to identify rare genetic mutations involved in every kind of disease by scanning DNA from volunteers who agreed to have their genomes sequenced and to provide access to detailed medical records. The project is made possible by a dramatic fall in the cost of genetic sequencing. It took government-funded scientists $3 billion and 13 years to sequence the first human genome by 2003. Today, it costs around $1,000 and takes just three days.AstraZeneca will work with Venter’s U.S. company Human Longevity Inc (HLI), which will sequence the genomes, including 1 million from HLI’s database, and use machine-learning software to find patterns in genetic variations.The British group, which is establishing an in-house Centre for Genomics Research in Cambridge, where it is relocating its global headquarters, has also partnered with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute and Finland’s Institute for Molecular Medicine.AstraZeneca is not the first drugmaker to start amassing troves of human DNA in this way but Venter, one of the first scientists to sequence the human genome, said it was the biggest commitment to date by any pharmaceutical company.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals signed a deal with Pennsylvania’s Geisinger Health System two years ago to sequence partial genomes of some 250,000 volunteers, while Roche’s Genentech unit signed a deal last year for HLI to sequence tens of thousands of genomes.“The big thing here is the magnitude of what we are trying to do,” Pangalos said. “This takes it to a completely different level and I think it is going to be relevant of every therapeutic area.”Until now, the field of genomics has largely failed to live up to the hype of hoped-for medical breakthroughs, although more recently genetic understanding has been crucial in the development of some cancer treatments.Now, thanks to industrial-scale sequencing and advances in gene editing that allow scientists to quickly test the effects of genetic variations, progress is expected to accelerate.Venter believes it could also unleash a new era of forensics, with HLI trying to predict what people might look like from their DNA.AstraZeneca’s decision to embed genomics across its research and development follows a push last year by the company to expand gene testing into areas including heart disease and asthma.“I believe we really have finally turned the corner and genomics will become central in drug development efforts,” said David Goldstein, a genetics expert from Columbia University, who chairs AstraZeneca’s Genomics Advisory Board."
2016-4-28,Amgen profit sails past Street expectations; raises 2016 outlook,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XP2XF,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Thursday reported much higher-than-expected first-quarter profit as sales of several key drugs beat Wall Street estimates, and the company significantly raised its full-year earnings forecast.The rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel, bone fracture preventers Prolia and Xgeva and infection fighter Neulasta all performed better than analysts had projected.Excluding one-time items, the world’s largest biotechnology company reported adjusted earnings of $2.90 per share, topping analysts’ average expectations by 30 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Amgen said it now expected 2016 adjusted earnings of $10.85 to $11.20 per share, up from its prior forecast of $10.60 to $11.00 per share, and well ahead of analysts’ average expectations of $10.82.Amgen slightly raised its full-year revenue forecast to $22.2 billion to $22.6 billion from $22 billion to $22.5 billion.Sales of Enbrel, which also treats psoriasis, jumped 24 percent to $1.39 billion, largely due to a price increase. Analysts had expected about $1.25 billion.Sales of Neulasta rose 4 percent to $1.18 billion, while Prolia sales jumped 29 percent to $352 million.“We expect continued growth from Prolia for years,” commercial operations chief Tony Hooper told analysts on a conference call after the company released earnings.Quarterly results were also helped by payments from a licensing deal and a recently adopted accounting standard on how taxes are calculated on compensation.The company for the first time reported sales of its potent new cholesterol fighter, Repatha, which totaled just $16 million for the quarter.Insurers have made it difficult for patients prescribed with Repatha and a rival drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals to qualify for reimbursement. The policies are not expected to change until large studies prove the expensive treatments prevent heart attacks and deaths in addition to dramatically lowering “bad” LDL cholesterol.“Ongoing results continue to be good as they manage the business while awaiting important clinical data to open up a multibillion-dollar product. That’s pretty exciting,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said.Amgen has said it was expecting the first of those results in the second half of this year.“We will continue to work with payers to improve access to Repatha,” Hooper said, adding that cardiologists trying to get the treatment for appropriate patients are “extremely frustrated.”The company said net profit rose to $1.9 billion, or $2.50 per share, from $1.62 billion, or $2.11 per share, a year ago.Revenue rose 10 percent to $5.53 billion, topping Wall Street estimates of $5.32 billion.Amgen shares rose to $161.75 in extended trading after closing at $160.56 on Nasdaq."
2016-4-28,Express Scripts plans fiercer fight against sudden drug price hikes,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XP2W3,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co plans to introduce several benefit programs aimed at fighting high drug costs, including speeding up how quickly it moves insurer and employer customers to cheaper medicines after sudden price hikes, its chief medical officer said.Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, is discussing the changes with its customers at an annual meeting in Florida today, Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview.Last year, the sudden 5000 percent price hike by Turing Pharmaceuticals for Daraprim, an anti-infective treatment for a rare disease, caught hospitals and patients by surprise and spurred investigations and hearings in Congress. Drug pricing has since become a national issue, taken up by Presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump.After that, Express Scripts and its next largest competitor CVS Health found cheaper alternatives for patients, but Express said the new program will make it easier for customers to switch plans quickly.Express and CVS began several years ago trying to cut spending for customers by narrowing coverage choices and being tougher about patient authorization. This year, CVS also started a specific program to try to limit patient use of expensive dermatology drugs, like Valeant Pharmaceuticals’ pricey Jublia toe fungus cream.Miller said Express Scripts planned to expand a new pricing scheme in which it pays for cancer drugs based on how well studies show they work for a particular disease. He said it was looking at other therapeutic areas, such as arthritis and inflammatory diseases for 2017.Rheumatoid arthritis drugs like AbbVie’s Humira, Amgen Inc.’s Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson’s Remicade are among the top selling drugs in this category and have had large price increases over the years.Another therapeutic area Express Scripts is watching closely is dermititis, with two new highly-effective drugs potentially hitting the market this year, one from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. It is also working on diabetes, where it is expecting cheaper treatments to hit the market by the end of the year."
2016-5-02,Regeneron pain drug clears late-stage trial,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XT0ZI,"(Reuters) - Drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Monday its experimental drug to treat moderate-to-severe osteoarthritis pain was successful in a late-stage study.The drug, fasinumab, was tested on 421 patients with a history of inadequate pain relief or intolerance to current pain killers.After 16 weeks, patients given fasinumab reported less pain, as measured on a physician-grade scale, than those given a placebo, Regeneron said in a statement.Current treatments for pain management include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, anti-seizure agents, and opiates. However, these drugs cause multiple side-effects and often prove to be toxic with long-term use.Fasinumab binds to nerve growth factor (NGF) proteins and block their activity, reducing pain.A number of companies, including Pfizer Inc and Eli Lilly & Co, are developing drugs that target NGFs.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration placed fasinumab and other experimental agents targeting NGF on partial clinical hold in December 2012 after reports that animals treated with these drugs had nerve damage.Fasinumab is no longer on clinical hold, according to Regeneron’s website."

2016-5-03,Big pharma dominates ranking of stocks with best five-year returns,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XU1IU,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. pharmaceutical companies dominated an annual global ranking of top 10 large-cap stocks with the best five-year returns, according to an analysis released on Tuesday by Boston Consulting Group.Drug company Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O, which had an average annual total share return of 75.3 percent, was the top performer. Allergan AGN.N and Gilead Sciences GILD.O, with 43.3 percent and 41.4 percent average annual returns, respectively, took second and third place. Companies with over $4 billion in market cap were considered for the list and ranked based on share gains and dividend yields between 2011 and 2015. Some 2,000 stocks were analyzed.Big pharma had a total of four companies make the list. The fourth, Biogen BIIB.O, landed in the No. 6 spot.Seven of the top 10 stocks ranked highest for creating value for shareholders were U.S. companies.Several technology and media companies, including South Africa's Naspers NPNJn.J, China's Tencent 0700.HK and U.S.-based Netflix NFLX.O, also made the list. Besides pharma, industries that delivered the highest shareholder returns over the past five years include healthcare services, followed by media and publishing and travel and tourism. Commodity industries - oil, metals and mining - rank at the bottom of the list, BCG’s report said.Investors appear to be cashing in on some gains, with the S&P 500 Health Care Sector .SPXHC down 2.7 percent year-to-date.Since Boston Consulting began publishing its analysis of top value-creating stocks in 1999, 89 companies have made the list -with fewer than half doing so a second time, the report said.Only 19 companies have appeared on the list three years or more, including Apple Inc AAPL.O, Amazon.com AMZN.O, Ambev SA ABEV3.SA China's Baidu Inc BIDU.O and Tencent, a Chinese social media company. Regeneron, Netflix, Visa V.N, Japan's communications provider KDDI 9433.T and MasterCard MA.N, with a 34.7 percent average annual return, appeared on the top 10 for the first time.“We’re always quite surprised at how much change there is one year to another,” said Hady Farag, a New York-based principal at BCG who co-authored the report.While pharmaceutical companies have ranked high in recent years, individual companies with sustainable revenue growth and strong business plans, rather than those “riding industry trends,” have consistently done well, Farag said."
2016-5-04,Sanofi sees \'strong strategic\' fit with U.S. Medivation,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XV1RP,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi SASY.PA sees a strong strategic fit with Medivation MDVN.O even though its tie-up proposal was rejected by the U.S. cancer drug maker last week, the company's chief executive said on Wednesday.The French drugmaker went public with a $9.3 billion proposal to buy Medivation on April 28 but the target said offer undervalued the company and its pipeline of drugs.U.S firm Pfizer PFE.N has also approached Medivation to express interest in an acquisition, raising the possibility of a bid rivaling Sanofi's, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday.“We have a strong strategic complementarity with this company,” Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said of Medivation at the group’s annual shareholder meeting in Paris.He didn’t say if Sanofi would raise its offer.“We will only move forward to a point where we create value,” Sanofi chairman Serge Weinberg said. “Of course, it is out of question to say here where that point is.”Sanofi is keen to boost its presence in cancer treatments and already has teamed up last year with U.S firm Regeneron REGN.O in immuno-oncology. Immuno-oncology differs from traditional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy as its uses or enhances the patient’s own immune system to be able to stop the growth of cancer cells.Brandicourt said much had still to be done to catch up with rivals such as Switzerland's Roche ROG.S or Novartis NOVN.S.“We are making progress with Regeneron but coming back to Medivation, the complementarity comes from the fact they are very involved in prostate cancer,” Brandicourt said.Based in San Francisco, Medivation is known for its prostate cancer treatment Xtandi while Sanofi markets its own drug for the disease, Jevtana."
2016-5-05,"Sanofi ready to up offer for drugmaker Medivation, could oust board",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1820P8,"PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - France’s Sanofi said it could raise its proposed $9.3 billion deal to buy Medivation if the U.S. cancer drugmaker engaged in talks, threatening to go directly to shareholders to oust the board if not.Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt wrote in a letter to the board of Medivation published on Thursday that the transaction was a priority for the French drugmaker and it was committed to seeing it through.San Francisco-based Medivation said on Thursday it had received a letter from Sanofi that “simply restates an inadequate proposal that... substantially undervalues the Company, its leading oncology franchise, and innovative late-stage pipeline”.Brandicourt said Sanofi had spoken to top Medivation shareholders and the proposal had “overwhelming” support.“If you engage in good faith discussions with us and demonstrate additional value, we could be in a position to revise our offer,” the CEO wrote. “If you are not prepared to engage with us, we have no choice but to go directly to your shareholders.”Sanofi said rules in the state of Delaware, where Medivation is registered, gave shareholders owning a majority of the company the power to oust the board.“If the Medivation board of directors continues to refuse to engage with us, then we intend to commence a process to remove and replace members of the board,” Brandicourt said.In its quarterly earnings call on Wednesday, Medivation’s Chief Executive Officer David Hung said that Medivation’s major shareholders had been “very supportive” of the board’s choice to reject Sanofi’s bid.He declined to comment on whether Medivation would run a sale process to explore offers from other potential bidders.Sanofi went public with the takeover proposal on April 28, but Medivation rejected the $52.50-a-share deal outright, saying it undervalued the company “substantially”. The stock has since risen to over $59.“We believe we have offered a fair price, and a very attractive premium,” Brandicourt wrote in the letter. “We remain enthusiastic about a potential combination with Medivation.”Medivation’s first-quarter earnings missed most analysts’ forecasts. The San Francisco-based company reported non-GAAP net income of 11 cents per diluted share, up from 8 cents a year earlier, but much less than the average 23 cents expected by analysts in a Thomson Reuters poll.Sanofi is keen to boost its presence in cancer treatments and teamed up last year with U.S firm Regeneron in immuno-oncology. This differs from traditional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiotherapy as it uses or enhances the patient’s own immune system to stop the growth of cancer cells.Medivation, known for its Xtandi prostate cancer treatment, said on Thursday its board of directors “believes the execution of Medivation’s business plan will deliver value to its stockholders that is far superior to Sanofi’s proposal”.The U.S. company will announce first-quarter results after the market closes on Thursday.U.S drug maker Pfizer has also approached Medivation to express interest in an acquisition, raising the possibility of a bid rivalling Sanofi’s, people familiar with the matter said on Tuesday."

2016-5-05,Regeneron secures more coverage for cholesterol drug Praluent,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1821WP,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, facing slowing sales of blockbuster eye drug Eylea, said it was making substantial progress in securing more insurance coverage for cholesterol drug Praluent, its other key product.Shares of the company, which reported better-than-expected first-quarter revenue, rose as much 5.8 percent on Thursday.Praluent, which is co-owned by Sanofi SA, has often been touted as the company’s next blockbuster but the cholesterol-lowering drug has been slow to take off in the market with insurers resisting its high cost.Regeneron said on Thursday about 74 percent of commercially insured lives and 91 percent of Medicare insured lives had access to Praluent, as of April 1.Unprecedented utilization criteria for the drug and tedious paperwork put in place by pharmacy benefit managers and health insurers had made access to Praluent difficult, Regeneron said on a call with analysts.However, the company said it had seen a recent improvement in the number of Praluent prescriptions that were filled.RBC Capital Markets analyst Adnan Butt said upcoming data from trials on Praluent’s cardiovascular benefits will likely make insurers loosen their restrictions on the drug.“That’s the big catalyst the buyside is looking for - statistically significant difference that makes it difficult for payers to deny the benefit this class of drugs is showing.”The list price of Praluent is about $14,600 per year. Rival drug Repatha, made by Amgen Inc, has a list price of $14,100 per year.A federal jury ruled in March that Praluent infringes two Amgen patents, making matters worse for Regeneron.Praluent’s first-quarter sales were about $13 million, falling short of the average analyst estimate of $15.6 million, JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said.Regeneron raised sales growth forecast for Eylea, the success of which has powered much of Regeneron’s explosive growth since late 2011.However, the drug’s slowing sales in recent quarters have raised concerns about Regeneron’s prospects, erasing a quarter of the company’s market value in the past year.Regeneron said it expected sales of Eylea, which treats wet age-related macular degeneration among other eye disorders, to increase by 20-25 percent this year, compared with its previous estimate of about 20 percent. The drug’s sales surged 54 percent last year.Regeneron’s net income more than doubled to $165.7 million in the quarter ended March 31.Excluding items, Regeneron earned $2.57 per share, just missing the average analyst estimate of $2.58 according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Revenue rose to $1.20 billion, beating the average Wall Street estimate of $1.18 billion.Regeneron’s shares were up 5.2 percent at $379.42 in late afternoon trading."
2016-5-05,"Sanofi, Amgen cholesterol drugs win UK backing after price cuts",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0XW2GV,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two rival cholesterol-lowering injections from Sanofi and Amgen have been recommended by Britain’s healthcare cost watchdog after the manufacturers offered special discounts to the country’s state-run health service.Sanofi’s Praluent, which was developed with Regeneron, and Amgen’s Repatha are both so-called PCSK9 medicines that work in a different way to existing cholesterol fighters such as statins.The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) said in draft guidance on Friday that both drugs could be considered for use by people whose cholesterol is still not under control despite trying other treatments.It stressed that the medicines would only be cost-effective with the promised discounts.Both drugs cost more than 4,000 pounds ($5,780) per patient a year in Britain. That is already a lot less than their U.S. list price of around $14,000, but Sanofi and Amgen have committed to discount the British price by a further undisclosed amount for the UK National Health Service.While Praluent and Repatha are both viewed by analysts as eventual multi-billion-dollar-a-year sellers, demand for the medicines in markets worldwide so far has proved disappointing."
2016-5-11,"Cigna makes deals with Amgen, Sanofi for pricey cholesterol drugs",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0Y21J1,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Cigna Corp signed deals that will pay the makers of two potent but pricey cholesterol-lowering treatments based on how well their customers respond to the medications, the health insurer said on Wednesday.The treatments, Repatha from Amgen Inc and Praluent sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi, hit the market last summer with a list price of more than $14,000 per year. They were approved for patients unable to tolerate or who are not able to adequately control “bad” LDL cholesterol with statins, such as Lipitor, the most commonly prescribed drugs for cholesterol. Statins typically cost only hundreds of dollars a year.The deals are the highest profile examples to date of insurers basing payments on how well medicines perform for patients. Cigna and Aetna Inc signed deals this year for Entresto, a heart failure drug from Novartis that had slow sales because of its high price.With no price controls on prescription medicines in the United States, as they have in Europe and elsewhere, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have become far more aggressive in demanding price discounts and limiting access to expensive new medicines.Under the new agreements, if customers do not reduce LDL to levels seen in clinical trials, the drugmakers will further discount the cost. If the treatments meet or exceed anticipated cholesterol reduction, the negotiated price remains in place, Cigna said.Cigna declined to disclose the prices negotiated, or level of LDL reduction it will use to determine if further discounts are in order. In extensive clinical trials, the drugs reduced LDL by 60 percent or more.Regeneron’s head of commercial operations, Robert Terifay, said he expects insurers to increasingly use value analyses to determine payment for chronic conditions, including asthma and heart disease.He said Regeneron had signed deals with other payers to assess the value of Praluent, but declined to identify them.The drugmakers have reported meager sales of Repatha and Praluent, injectable biotech drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors, as insurers have been slow to approve customers seeking the treatments.Amgen last month said some three-quarters of Repatha prescriptions have been denied, and doctors have expressed frustration over the barriers to getting the new medicines to patients.“We continue to work with payers to help them see the unintended consequences of an onerous system, resulting in patients with high LDL levels not getting access to Repatha,” Amgen said in a statement.Cigna has a process in place “that ensures timely access to these very important breakthrough medications for the population that really needs these medications, while ensuring that there isn’t a lot of inappropriate or unnecessary utilization,” Chris Bradbury, senior vice president of Cigna Pharmacy, said in an interview.Some reimbursement barriers are expected to be removed if large ongoing trials demonstrate that the drugs prevent heart attacks and deaths in addition to dramatically lowering LDL. The first of those results are expected later this year.Aetna said it chose not to engage in a similar performance-based reimbursement arrangement at this time. “As more cardiovascular outcomes data becomes available, we’ll revisit our options,” Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said.Cigna said it will analyze integrated medical and pharmacy claims data to determine if its customers treated with PCSK9s experience cardiovascular improvements to get a sense of the drugs’ benefits outside of the clinical trial setting.It will look for reductions in heart attacks and strokes, for example, Bradbury said.Cigna is seeking to understand the level of medical cost avoidance in order to determine “a fair market value for the price of the drugs,” Bradbury said.Amgen shares closed down nearly 2 percent on Wednesday, while Regeneron shares fell 3.6 percent, both on Nasdaq."

2016-5-12,Regeneron CEO says drug price critique by independent group unscientific,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1891MV,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer on Thursday took aim at an influential drug pricing watchdog, saying a critique of the company’s new cholesterol lowering therapy was non-scientific.The Boston-based Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) last fall reviewed two new potent cholesterol drugs called PCSK9 inhibitors. It concluded that the treatments should cost about 67 percent less than the list prices set by Regeneron with partner Sanofi, and by Amgen Inc.Health insurers have refused to cover the cost of the treatments in most cases, intensifying a high-profile fight over rising drug prices. ICER began doing value-based analyses last year with a review of new hepatitis C drugs, and has become a prominent voice casting doubt on the price and value of medications.Schleifer emphasized the importance of value-based drug pricing. On Wednesday, health insurer Cigna Corp said it had reached new reimbursement contracts for the cholesterol medicines based on how well they perform for patients.Speaking at the Financial Times U.S. Healthcare & Life Sciences Summit, Schleifer said ICER’s method, which reduced the value of the treatments based on its assumption of what the United States could afford, lacked scientific basis.“They did all the calculations and they said it’s X, which is ok. I could have lived with that. But ... they said society can’t afford X, so we are going to say it’s one-third X,” Schleifer said during a panel discussion.“They had value-based pricing, but they just decided that well we can’t afford it. That wasn’t scientific. There was no intellectual honesty there.”ICER Chief Operating Officer Sarah Emond, on a panel with Schleifer, countered that budget impact is part of the equation.“You’re attacking the science of an independent non-profit whose entire mission is tied to opening the black box of pricing,” she said.Insurers and the government say value-based pricing can help keep drug prices from climbing too fast. Johnson & Johnson CEO Alex Gorsky said at the conference that it is “incumbent upon our industry to make sure we are moving towards more outcomes based models.”The new cholesterol fighters were approved for patients with a hereditary form of extreme high cholesterol and those with heart disease. Clinical data designed to show whether they can reduce the risk of heart attack and death in addition to lowering cholesterol are expected late this year and could help expand their reach to more patients."
2016-5-17,Pfizer\'s Anacor deal showcases new wave of eczema therapies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0Y80CX,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc's PFE.N purchase of Anacor Pharmaceuticals Inc ANAC.O heralds an approaching wave of potentially safer and more effective treatments for millions who suffer from eczema, a common skin condition which causes infection-prone rashes that can feel like having poison ivy 24 hours a day. More than two dozen drugmakers are working on novel medicines to treat the condition affecting about 20 million Americans, also known as atopic dermatitis, and Pfizer’s $5.2 billion deal positions it to become a market leader.Anacor's steroid-free topical ointment crisaborole is the first of the new treatments to be reviewed by U.S. regulators. An injectable therapy called dupilumab from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O is expected to be submitted for U.S. approval later this year. “Until a few years ago, I don’t think we had any message of hope for eczema patients who have tried everything,” said Gil Yosipovitch, chairman of dermatology at Temple University School of Medicine who is a paid consultant for both companies. “Now we do.”The two medicines greatly reduced eczema symptoms in late-stage trials without side effects accompanying current treatments. They could eventually see combined annual global sales of over $9 billion and face no significant competition for years.Yosipovitch said Anacor’s crisaborole could be a valuable option for the 60 percent to 80 percent of patients with mild and moderate eczema on localized areas of the body. Dupilumab would be used for patients with more severe disease, he said.The global eczema drug market is currently worth about $4 billion in sales, mostly of topical steroids than can cause skin atrophy and increase risk of glaucoma and cataracts. Doctors may also prescribe oral drugs that suppress the immune system, such as cyclosporine, but they are not approved for eczema and can cause infections, shingles and cancer. There are no approved systemic drugs for the condition.However, the cost of the new treatments may limit patient access. Regeneron’s injectable dupilumab could cost $25,000 a year, similar to psoriasis drugs, at a time when U.S. health insurers are resisting rising drug prices. Analysts say it could eventually capture annual sales of $6 billion, with Anacor’s drug costing more than $1,200 a year and having peak annual sales of up to $3 billion.“Payers know this will be a big market and will put up a lot of barriers and restrictions,” said Yatin Suneja, an analyst with Suntrust Robinson Humphrey.Express Scripts Inc ESRX.O last month said it would scrutinize new eczema treatments and their expected prices. Crisaborole blocks an inflammation-causing protein called PDE-4. In large clinical trials that included children and adults, it cleared or almost cleared treated areas of skin in half of patients with mild to moderate disease, with mild side effects.""We badly need a nonsteroidal topical that can get around serious steroid concerns and this drug showed no skin atrophy or other significant side effects,"" said Dr. Lawrence Eichenfield of the University of California San Diego and lead author of American Academy of Dermatology eczema treatment guidelines. Regeneron and Sanofi SASY.PA aim to seek approval for dupilumab this year for adults with moderate to severe eczema. It blocks two proteins, IL-4 and IL-13, believed to cause eczema and allergic conditions like asthma. In big trials, dupilumab led to an average 70 percent improvement in rash area and severity. Fewer serious side effects, including infections, were reported for dupilumab than for placebos. In separate studies it reduced incidence of asthma.One concern over drugs like dupilumab, which regulate the immune system, is potential for serious side effects over time, including lymphoma. Such problems typically do not show up until a patient has used a medicine many years, said Dr. Cameron Rokhsar, a New York dermatologist with no financial ties to the drugmakers.Roche Holding AG ROG.S and AstraZeneca Plc AZN.L are developing injectable eczema treatments several years behind dupilumab. Data from mid-stage trials of the Roche drug, lebrikizumab, are expected in the second quarter. AstraZeneca plans this year to disclose data from a mid-stage trial of its tralokinumab in adults with moderate to severe eczema.Nemolizumab from Japan's Chugai 4519.T is also being tested in a mid-stage trial. The injectable drug targets IL-31, a protein associated with itch, a hallmark of eczema.“The main concept of our drug is to break the vicious itch-scratch cycle because scratching damages the skin and causes more intense inflammation,” Dr. Michiaki Tanaka, a senior Chugai research executive, said in an interview.Celgene Inc CELG.O recently tested its psoriasis drug apremilast in about 200 patients with moderate to severe eczema. It has not publicized the results, but researchers and analysts say it could become the first approved oral treatment for eczema. The pill has caused nausea and other gastrointestinal problems in psoriasis patients. “I’m very excited about apremilast because we have no approved oral drug for eczema,” said Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky of Mt. Sinai Medical Center in New York. She helped conduct trials of apremilast and dupilumab."

2016-6-14,U.S. regulator says too many drugmakers chasing same cancer strategy,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN0YW15T,"(This June 10 story corrects reference to AstraZeneca drug to PD-L1 instead of PD-1, paragraph 10)CHICAGO (Reuters) - A new type of cancer drug that takes the brakes off the body’s immune system has given drugmakers some remarkable wins against the deadly disease, but a top U.S. regulator says too many companies are focused on the same approach.Dr. Richard Pazdur, head of the Food and Drug Administration’s office of oncology products, was referring to therapies designed to disable the PD-1 protein that tumors use to evade the immune system.The FDA has approved such treatments from Merck & Co MRK.N, Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY.N and Roche Holding AG ROG.S, each of which have list prices of $150,000 per year. At least five other drugmakers are developing similar medicines. “People should ask themselves ... would we be better off spending those resources into looking at more novel drugs?” Pazdur told Reuters during the annual American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago this week.Pazdur acknowledged that the success of a few drugmakers in the worldwide $110 billion market for cancer treatments makes it attractive for rivals to continue developing similar therapies rather than invest heavily in unproven approaches.“As with everything in drug development, it is about reduction of risk,” he said. But the number of similar drugs in development at the same time is a first in the oncology field, and latecomers to the PD-1 market will likely be relegated to “niche” indications, he added.Drug company executives disputed Pazdur’s critique. In interviews with Reuters, they argued that the science around cancer is advancing rapidly, with a focus on how to best combine therapies to attack multiple mechanisms of the disease, determine which patients are most likely to respond to them and how long patients will need to be treated.Bristol-Myers and Merck are widely viewed as leaders in the immunotherapy race, with treatments defying the odds to help patients fight off some of the deadliest cancers. Merck’s Keytruda was shown to help a significant number of patients with advanced melanoma live at least three years, while Bristol-Myers’ Opdivo prolonged life for some lung cancer patients by two years, according to data presented at the ASCO meeting.In practice, doctors say, around 20 percent of advanced cancer patients respond to the new drugs and a subset of those patients can have lasting remissions.AstraZeneca PLC's AZN.L PD-L1 drug, which similarly prevents tumors from evading detection, received ""breakthrough"" status from the FDA to expedite review for treating a type of bladder cancer. Other companies in earlier stages of development include Pfizer Inc PFE.N, in partnership with Germany's Merck KGaA MRCG.DE, Novartis AG NOVN.S, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O and China's BeiGene BGNE.O.“Our reason to go into PD-1s is not just to have a ‘me too’ drug,” said Israel Lowy, head of translational science and oncology at Regeneron, which has a PD-1 in early-stage trials. “Most people think that the future is in combinations ... Having our own PD-1 that is active and useful gives us enormous flexibility in how we do clinical trials.”Industry executives say they are investing in additional, potentially complementary, approaches to PD-1 treatment that can eventually be used against many types and stages of cancer.“We don’t look at ourselves as ‘latecomers.’ We are leading in multiple areas with combination therapies,” said Bahija Jallal, executive vice president at AstraZeneca’s MedImmune unit, which is testing its PD-1 candidate with a range of other experimental drugs. “The question is, how can we really follow the science,” Jallal said.At the ASCO meeting, for example, Pfizer presented early-stage data from a trial showing that its experimental agent 4-1BB, which aims to increase T-cells, was safe when combined with Merck’s Keytruda, but only two of 23 patients achieved complete remissions for a year.“Somebody may emerge with a surprise new mechanism,” said Leerink Partners pharmaceutical analyst Seamus Fernandez. He said drugs from Bristol-Myers and Merck will most likely become the standard of care for many patients.Pazdur and other experts agreed that the biggest opportunity for cancer immunotherapies will be their use earlier on in treatment. Fernandez said Bristol-Myers could “win the war,” if it succeeds with a combination of Opdivo and its other immunotherapy Yervoy as an initial treatment for advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Merck and Roche are testing their PD-1s combined with chemotherapy for the same purpose.In the end, patients may benefit from lower costs if Merck and Bristol-Myers face more rivals in the marketplace. Both Keytruda and Opdivo have a U.S. list price of about $150,000 per year.If combinations of expensive therapies become the norm, drugmakers could theoretically keep prices lower by mixing their own treatments rather than seeking permission from a rival.“The profits on oncology drugs are so high that ‘me-too’ drugs will be developed,” said Joel Hay, professor of pharmaceutical economics and policy at the University of Southern California. “They will ultimately reduce the profits in that class. That’s how competition is supposed to work.”"

Sales in Eylea, the drug jointly developed with Regeneron REGN.O which helps stem the loss of vision in the elderly, also exceed the market view.But Bayer also became the latest maker of farming supplies to take a hit as depressed prices of agricultural produce such as wheat and corn have prompted growers to reduce pesticide use to a minimum. Rival Syngenta said last week that excessive rainfall in Europe, among other factors, has kept farmers from spraying.Adjusted EBITDA at Bayer’s Crop Science unit dropped 8.2 percent to a worse-than-expected 663 million euros.Bayer last week pointed to Monsanto’s recent weak business performance to champion its sweetened $64 billion offer which Monsanto’s management had turned down."

2016-9-20,Amgen cholesterol drug reduces arterial plaque buildup: study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN11Q25N,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said on Tuesday its potent new cholesterol fighter, Repatha, met the primary and secondary goals of a study designed to show it can decrease plaque buildup in heart arteries of patients already taking widely used statin drugs, such as Lipitor.The biotechnology company, whose shares were up 1.6 percent, will present detailed data from the study at a major heart conference in November.Repatha belongs to an expensive new class of injectable drugs that dramatically lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol. The new medicines have a list price of more than $14,000 a year. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi sell a rival drug called Praluent. They are far more expensive than statins, which are almost all now available in cheap generic versions.Health insurers and other companies that negotiate prescription drug usage have been slow to cover the new medicines without evidence that they actually reduce heart attacks and deaths as statins do. Data from large studies expected to show that is expected next year.“One year after the FDA approved Repatha, nearly two-thirds of patients prescribed Repatha are still being denied access,” Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement.If the new drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, can halt or significantly reverse atherosclerosis, that could be a strong indicator they will be able to reduce heart attack risk.“Atherosclerosis is the major underlying cause of cardiovascular disease, which remains the leading cause of death worldwide,” Harper said.In the 78-week study of 968 heart patients already on optimum statin therapy, Repatha lowered the percentage of atheroma volume in coronary arteries and demonstrated some plaque regression.Amgen shares were up $2.77 at $174.15 on the Nasdaq in late morning."

2016-9-26,Sanofi may win U.S. approval of $3 billion eczema drug by March,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN11W0KD,"(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA and its U.S. partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O could win U.S. approval for their keenly awaited new eczema drug dupilumab, seen by analysts as a potential $3 billion-a-year seller, by next March.Sanofi badly needs new products to make up for flagging sales in its diabetes business, where its top-seller Lantus faces growing competition.The two companies said on Monday that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration had accepted dupilumab for priority review for treating atopic dermatitis (AD), a skin inflammation also known as atopic eczema, and set a target decision date of March 29.Dupilumab, an injectable antibody drug, is seen by investors as perhaps Sanofi’s most promising pipeline medicine, since it has produced promising clinical results and could be first systemic therapy for severe AD.The drug is also being developed for severe asthma, where it will compete with a wave of other new biotech medicines such as GlaxoSmithKline's GSK.L Nucala and Teva's TEVA.TA Cinqair.Industry analysts, on average, forecast annual sales for dupilumab of $3.0 billion by 2021, according to Thomson Reuters Cortellis."

It usually affects people over 50 and comes in two forms. Wet AMD, which is less common than dry AMD, is generally caused by abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid or blood into the retina.

2017-1-02,New drug approvals fall to six-year low in 2016,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN14M08R,"LONDON (Reuters) - Last year turned out to be a disappointing one for new drug approvals with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration clearing just 22 new medicines for sale, the lowest number since 2010 and sharply down on 2015’s tally of 45.Across the Atlantic, the European Medicines Agency recommended 81 new prescription products against a 2015 total of 93. Unlike the FDA, the EMA includes generic drugs in its list.The slowdown suggests the pharmaceuticals industry may be returning to more normal productivity levels after a spike in approvals in 2014 and 2015, when the haul of new drugs reaching the market hit a 19-year high.Several factors led to the fall in the approval rate in 2016, John Jenkins, the FDA’s director of the office of new drugs, told a conference last month.Notably, five new drugs that had been scheduled for approval in 2016 ended up winning an early green light at the end of 2015. There was also a decline in drugs being filed for approval and the FDA rejected or delayed more applications in 2016 than in the previous two years.Some of the delayed drugs may yet go on to win approval in 2017, including Roche’s multiple sclerosis treatment Ocrevus and Sanofi and Regeneron’s sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis.Most industry executives remain upbeat about the hunt for new medicines, given recent advances in fighting cancer and an improved understanding of the genetic basis of other diseases, which has resulted in full development pipelines at many firms.But it remains challenging to get new drugs through the approval process and to secure a decent financial return once they are launched, given resistance from healthcare insurers and governments to the rising cost of medical treatment.According to consultancy Deloitte, returns on research and development investment at the top 12 pharmaceutical companies fell to just 3.7 percent in 2016 from a high of 10.1 percent in 2010.Increasing political pressure over the high prices of many modern medicines is a growing challenge at a time when biotech and pharma companies are developing more drugs targeted at niche patient populations.The issue is exemplified by the last drug to win FDA approval in 2016. Spinraza, from Biogen and Ionis Pharmaceuticals, is the first medicine to treat patients with spinal muscular atrophy, a rare and often fatal genetic disease. It comes at a huge cost of $125,000 per dose.That price, implying a total cost of $625,000 to $750,000 for patients in the first year and $375,000 in subsequent years, is likely to invite “a storm of criticism, up to and including Presidential tweets”, according to Leerink analysts.President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to bring down drug prices.For a graphic on U.S. FDA drug approvals, click:"

2017-1-05,"Regeneron, Sanofi to appeal US judge\'s ban on cholesterol drug sales",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1EV228,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA said on Thursday they would appeal the U.S. District Court ruling which banned the two companies from selling their cholesterol drug, Praluent, on grounds of patent infringement.A federal judge had earlier blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling the drug after Amgen Inc accused them of infringing its patents.U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Delaware had ordered that the ban not take effect for 30 days to give Sanofi and Regeneron time to appeal.“It is our longstanding position that Amgen’s patent claims are invalid and that the best interests of patients will be greatly disserved by an injunction preventing access to Praluent,” Sanofi’s Executive Vice President Karen Linehan said in a statement.Amgen was up about 4 percent in after-hours trading, while Sanofi’s U.S. shares were down 3.6 percent. Regeneron was down 1.1 percent before the company requested that trading be halted.Amgen had sought the ban in an October 2014 lawsuit against Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron. It said Praluent, a drug intended to lower “bad” LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9, infringed its patents related to the protein.Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha.A jury found Amgen’s patents valid in March. The defendants said after the verdict that they planned to appeal to the U.S. Federal Circuit Court of Appeals, which reviews patent disputes.The companies could still decide to reach a settlement that would give Amgen royalties on Praluent sales.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Praluent and Repatha to reduce bad cholesterol in 2015.The drugs are more costly than other cholesterol drugs, with a list price topping $14,000 annually.Sales of the expensive new drugs, seen as potential blockbusters, have been very slow to take off as health insurers and other payers have been reluctant to pay for them. Amgen reported just $40 million in Repatha sales in the third quarter.Both drugs are in the final stages of enormous trials designed to demonstrate that they can lower the risk of heart attacks and deaths, which is expected to help open the insurer purse strings if successful. So-called outcomes results for Repatha are expected this quarter.“If Praluent was gone from the market the long-term peak sales for Repatha could move from $2 billion to $3 billion to $4 billion worldwide, in theory,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee said in a research note. He added that without the outcomes results, the potential size of the market remained uncertain. (Additional reporting by Bill Berkrot in New York and Nikhil Subba in Bengaluru)"

That was extended to 45 days on Monday.Speaking at the annual JP Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, Schleifer said Amgen had refused a request to delay any ban of Praluent sales until the appeal is heard, even though the judge in her ruling had said competition among the two drugs was in the public interest.“If they really cared about patients they wouldn’t rip this drug from patients,” the outspoken Schleifer said.“To say that you cannot wait, is that putting patients first? It’s no small wonder that our industry isn’t beloved,” he continued.“If this industry is to survive, we have got to do the right thing by patients ... and still adequately reward our investors,” Schleifer said.Earlier at the conference, Amgen CEO Robert Bradway reiterated that his company intended to defend its patents.

2017-10-04,Insurers are slow to approve pricey new cholesterol drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1C92XF,"(Reuters Health) - During the first year an expensive class of new cholesterol-lowering drugs was on the market, only one in three patients with a prescription actually received the therapy due to lack of insurance approval and high copays, according to a study sponsored by a manufacturer of one such drug.The drugs, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, are intended for use by adults whose “bad” low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels remain dangerously high even though they’re taking maximal doses of traditional cholesterol-lowering medications.Because PCSK9 inhibitors can cost up to $14,000 per year, insurance companies usually require prior authorization and patient copays.In the new study, the rate of insurance company approval of PCSK9 inhibitors was 47.2 percent. Ultimately, only 34.7 percent of patients prescribed the medicine ever picked it up due to its high out-of-pocket cost.The higher the copay, the higher the rate of “prescription abandonment,” the study found. When the copay was more than $350, more than 75 percent of patients didn’t pick up the medication.For the analysis, published in JAMA Cardiology, researchers examined pharmacy claims data on 45,029 patients prescribed PCSK9 inhibitors in the U.S. in 2015 and 2016.The two PCSK9 inhibitors approved in the U.S. are Praluent (alirocumab) marketed by Sanofi/Regeneron and Repatha (evolocumab) marketed by Amgen, the sponsor of the current study. Overall, this class of injectable drugs has been shown to lower LDL cholesterol levels by up to 60 percent.Twenty percent of patients in the study received approval from their insurance provider on the first day. Of those whose prescriptions were rejected, 73.5 percent appealed or resubmitted, after which an additional 45.4 percent were approved to receive the medication.Most of the time, PCSK9 inhibitors get denied the first time around, said lead study author Dr. Ann Marie Navar of the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina.“Personally, every time I prescribe PCSK9 (inhibitors) it takes me three to six hours of work between filling out forms and being on the phone with insurers. On the aggregate the burden of prescribing it is increasing and becoming quite onerous,” Navar told Reuters Health by phone.Dr. Robert Eckel, professor of medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver and former president of the American Heart Association, told Reuters Health that when he prescribes PCSK9 inhibitors, he often hears back from an insurance company with an approval within half an hour.“I know the indications of the drug, how to assess its risk and when I need to push hard,” he said. “I often also explain to my patients upfront that I’m the prescribing physician and not in a position to discuss copays.”Navar noted that cardiologists in the study were more successful than internists or endocrinologists at getting insurance approval, possibly because cardiologists are more likely to pick the right therapy for patients who meet the right criteria for drug approval. Specialty pharmacies that help patients navigate the paperwork process were also more successful.Weaknesses in the study make it impossible to know whether denial of prescriptions was inappropriate, however.For example, data on use of statins or LDL level were only available for a small subset of participants. Also, Eckel pointed out, there was no information about why approval was declined for some patients. “This is a very important piece of data that’s related to whether the prescribing physicians followed the approved indications for the drug,” he said.“I’m not surprised by what the study found, but I’m not sure who’s at fault here,” Eckel said.Dr. Navar has had financial relationships with both Amgen and Sanofi/Regeneron.SOURCE: bit.ly/2fRtHpd JAMA Cardiology, online September 27, 2017."

2017-10-05,"U.S. court reverses ban on sale of Regeneron, Sanofi cholesterol drug",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1CA1PG,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Thursday threw out a ban on the sale of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA’s cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent, and ordered a new trial after finding a jury was given improper instructions.The ruling from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington was a setback for Amgen Inc, which claimed Praluent infringed patents on its rival drug, Repatha, and had won the sales ban after a jury trial.Amgen, which brought its lawsuit in 2014, said in a statement it was disappointed by the court’s action. “We firmly believe in the validity of our patents and we look forward to reasserting our rights in court.”Regeneron shares jumped 4.4 percent to $475.95 on the Nasdaq, while Sanofi shares in Paris rose 0.8 percent. Amgen shares were off 1.5 percent at $185.76 on the Nasdaq.Praluent and Repatha are injectable biotech medicines created from manmade antibodies that dramatically lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol in the blood by blocking a protein called PCSK9.Amgen claimed its patents covered a broad range of antibodies that bind to PCSK9, while Sanofi and Regeneron argued such broad patents were invalid.In Thursday’s decision, the Federal Circuit said jurors were given instructions that could have wrongly led them to believe that describing a protein like PCSK9 was enough to patent a broad class of possible antibodies.The appeals court also found that the judge in the case improperly excluded some evidence that Regeneron and Sanofi wanted to use at the trial.“We are pleased with the Federal Circuit’s decision to remand for a new trial that allows us to present our complete evidence to the jury,” Sanofi General Counsel Karen Linehan said.In a joint statement, Regeneron and Sanofi said a new trial has not yet been scheduled and they do not expect proceedings to start this year.Mizuho Securities analyst Salim Sayed said he expects the ruling will keep Praluent on the market for at least another year.A jury had found Amgen’s patents valid last March. Sanofi and Regeneron did not dispute that if the patents were valid, Praluent infringed them.In January, U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Delaware took the unusual step of blocking sales of Praluent. She found that, although having both drugs on the market would be in the public interest, Amgen’s patent rights outweighed that concern.Praluent sales were allowed to continue during the appeals process.Zachary Silbersher, a New York-based patent lawyer not connected with the case, said the court’s ruling will make it more difficult for Amgen to win if it goes to trial again, which could push the company to settle.Praluent and Repatha won U.S. approval to reduce LDL cholesterol in 2015. The drugs are far more costly than other cholesterol drugs, with a list price topping $14,000 annually.Hurdles to patient access by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have led to disappointingly low sales so far. But Amgen’s drug has steadily gained market share since the court ruling, which threatened to remove Praluent from the market, rising to nearly 65 percent."

(bit.ly/2xbQD5H)Shares of rival Aimmune Therapeutics Inc, which is developing an oral peanut allergy pill, soared about 40 percent to $35.65 after market.Aimmune is expected to announce results of its late-stage trial early next year.Preliminary results of DBV’s trial show 12 months of the treatment resulted in 35.3 percent of patients achieving a certain tolerance, versus a higher-than-expected 13.6 percent response from a placebo group.However, DBV said the results showed a statistically significant response with a favorable tolerability profile.Plans to submit a marketing application for the patch to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) next year remain unchanged, the company said.DBV is also testing a similar patch to treat cow milk-related allergies in a mid-stage trial, the results of which are expected early next year.Leerink analyst Dae Gon Ha estimated DBV’s peak sales, including the peanut and milk allergy patches, of about 1.8 billion euros ($2.12 billion) in 2027.There are currently no U.S. regulator-approved treatments for peanut allergies, the leading cause of death from food-induced allergic reactions in the United States.The market is desperate for recourse, experts say, as peanut allergies have more than doubled in children from 1997 to 2008, and affect about two percent American children.Those afflicted risk potentially fatal anaphylaxis, a severe allergic reaction, even if exposed to trace amounts of peanut protein.Viaskin Peanut, which must be replaced daily, delivers peanut protein to patients’ immune systems via the skin, desensitizing them to small doses of the allergen over time.Unlike an oral drug, the patch avoids contact with the blood stream, lessening the risk of adverse reactions, DBV told Reuters.Earlier this month, Aimmune said it planned to test its pill in a mid-stage trial with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s and Sanofi’s drug dupilumab."

Sales outside the United States, which are booked by Bayer AG, rose 20 percent.The drug gets about 70 percent of its sales for wet age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, with about 25 percent from diabetic macular edema (DME).Regeneron said it sees opportunity for significant growth in DME for which the majority of patients are either untreated or receiving inferior laser therapy. The company also expects to seek approval in the second half of 2018 for Eylea for another vision-threatening condition related to diabetes, diabetic retinopathy, if Phase III data proves positive.Excluding items, Regeneron earned $3.99 per share for the quarter, exceeding analysts’ average forecast by 14 cents, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.“The numbers on the quarter were very reassuring for investors,” said Leerink Partners analyst Geoffrey Porges. “After what had been a rocky earnings season for the biopharma sector, this was something of a relief.”Several companies, including Celgene Corp, Gilead Sciences Inc, Biogen Inc and Merck & Co saw steep share price declines after reporting third-quarter results or growth issues for key drugs that disappointed investors.Sales of $89 million for Dupixent, previously reported by partner Sanofi, beat analysts’ average estimate by about $16 million.About 500 new prescriptions a week are being written for the drug for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, a type of eczema, with more than 90 percent of patients refilling their prescriptions, the company said.“The Dupixent number suggested continued growth in its initial indication and there’s at least one new major indication just around the corner,” Porges said.Regeneron is about to launch a television ad campaign for Dupixent in hopes of capturing more moderate eczema patients, and is awaiting an approval decision for the treatment of severe asthma.“We recognize this will be a very competitive area,” admitted Chief Executive Len Schleifer.However, Regeneron believes Dupixent will be differentiated from rivals because it improves lung function as well as reducing asthma flare-ups.The drug is also being tested for nasal polyps and a chronic, allergic inflammatory disease of the esophagus.Regeneron’s potent but expensive cholesterol fighter Praluent continued to struggle with just $49 million in sales. It has lost market share to Amgen’s rival Repatha, while both are still battling barriers to patient access from insurers and pharmacy benefit managers.Praluent’s future will also hinge on the outcome of an upcoming patent infringement trial brought by Amgen.Total revenue, which includes collaboration revenue from partners Sanofi and Bayer, rose 23 percent to $1.50 billion, beating estimates of $1.46 billion.Regeneron shares were up $11.15, or 2.8 percent, at $415.54 in late morning trade after earlier climbing as high as $432.50."

2017-11-10,Novartis posts eye drug data amid play for Eylea\'s turf,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DA2XT,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s bid to move in on Bayer’s and Regeneron’s eye-drug turf was buoyed on Friday by data showing patients on the Swiss drugmaker’s new RTH258 drug showed less disease activity than those on its rivals’ drug Eylea.Active disease was observed in 23.5 percent of RTH258 patients versus 33.5 percent of Eylea patients at 16 weeks, Novartis said, of its investigational treatment for wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), where abnormal, leaky blood vessels can cause blindness.A second, similar study found active disease in 21.9 percent of RTH258 patients versus 31.4 percent of those on Eylea for the condition affecting 20-25 million people worldwide.Novartis in June touted initial data showing its drug may require fewer injections directly into the eye than Eylea, while matching it on vision and safety measures.The Basel-based drugmaker hopes this latest analysis lends RTH258 additional muscle when matched head-to-head with Eylea as well as Lucentis, which Roche sells in the United States.“When you take all of that together ... we believe we have a very compelling proposition,” Vas Narasimhan, Novartis’s chief drug developer who will become CEO in 2018, said on a conference call.Novartis, which released the data at the American Academy of Opthalmology conference in New Orleans, predicts RTH258 annual sales will top $1 billion and aims to file for U.S. approval in late 2018.Making it a success is by no means clear sailing.For one, Novartis owns Lucentis rights in Europe where it has contractual obligations to continue marketing that drug. Analysts say cannibalization from RTH258 will be a challenge.Competition abounds, too: Eylea, with $5 billion in annual sales, has made inroads against the $3.2 billion-per-year Lucentis, whose 2020 U.S. patent expiration will expose it to cheaper copies.Moreover, Roche’s cancer drug Avastin is effective in off-label AMD use and has won favor because it costs a fraction of Lucentis and Eylea. In Britain, Novartis and Bayer are fighting doctor groups aiming to switch to Avastin.Other would-be rivals are racing to market, too.Allergan, whose investigational Abicipar is in Phase III trials, is also trumpeting prospects of reduced injections compared to Lucentis. Gene therapies may also be on the distant horizon.Still, Novartis’s Narasimhan remains optimistic for RTH258’s reception when it hits the market, likely in 2019.“When you actually see an image of a patient having a needle inserted into their eye, this is something patients definitely want to avoid,” he said.“Retinal surgeons have busy offices and want to do more complex retinal surgery. Today, they have offices filled with patients waiting for injections.”"

2017-11-13,Poor earnings updates keep European shares at 7-week low,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1DD0T3,"LONDON/MILAN (Reuters) - Heavy losses in utility EDF EDF.PA after a profit warning and other disappointing company updates weighed on European shares on Monday, pushing the pan-European benchmark to its lowest level since end-September.The pan-European STOXX 600 .STOXX was 0.7 percent lower at its close, with almost every sector ending in negative territory. This was the STOXX 600’s fifth straight session of losses, its longest losing streak since the end of May, though Schroders’ head of multi-asset investing for Europe, Aymeric Forest, said 2017 as a whole has been a record year for equities, with realized volatility hitting all-time low levels.France’s EDF was the biggest faller on the day, dropping more than 10 percent after lowering its 2018 earnings and cash flow forecasts.This was due to lower than expected power consumption, lower availability of some of its nuclear reactors in early 2018 and a drop in capacity compensation in Britain.Exane BNP Paribas affirmed its underperform rating on EDF.“The market is overly focused on the power price strength and not reflecting appropriately all the other issues facing the group, including the fact that if nuclear output falls short of expectations, higher power prices are actually a negative for them,” it said in an email to clients.Sonova SOON.S was another faller, down 2.4 percent.The Swiss hearing aid maker reported first-half results that fell short of analyst expectations, as sales in the U.S. were dented by an overhaul of the company’s retail network there.According to Thomson Reuters IBES data, about 76 percent of MSCI EMU companies have reported earnings so far, with 50 percent of them beating expectations. That compares to 72 percent for the S&P 500 and 54 percent for the broader MSCI Europe index.However results from pharma heavyweight Novartis NOVN.S were welcomed by the market.

The PCSK9 protein made by this gene was undetectable in the treated mice, which also experienced a 35 percent drop in total cholesterol, the researchers reported.High levels of cholesterol can clog arteries, causing reduced blood flow that can lead to a heart attack or stroke.The team is now working to identify other liver diseases that might benefit from this approach, and refining this approach for use in people.“If you can reprogram the DNA of your liver while you’re still using it, we think there are many diseases that could be addressed,” Anderson said."

2017-12-13,France\'s Sanofi pins hopes on new drugs after setbacks,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1OD0NT,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi’s promising pipeline of experimental drugs can help it overcome setbacks including the low uptake of a new cholesterol treatment and concerns about a dengue vaccine, the French pharmaceuticals group said on Wednesday.The world’s sixth largest drugmaker, battling to contain the fallout from a safety row in the Philippines over dengue vaccine Dengvaxia, said it expected to file nine medicines for regulatory assessment in the next 18 months.Shares in Sanofi were down 0.77 percent at 1510 GMT.Some investors have voiced discontent with the group’s product pipeline and its failure to make a large acquisition since it appointed Olivier Brandicourt as chief executive in 2015.Sanofi is under pressure to stand out in research and development as its diabetes division still has to overcome pricing constraints in the United States, the world’s largest health market, where its blockbuster insulin medication Lantus has lost its patent.In opening remarks at a company investor day, Brandicourt said the group was “on track” to sell its European generic drugs unit in “the coming year”, a long-awaited deal which could be worth more than 2 billion euros ($2.35 billion), sources say.“We are making good progress overall on our roadmap and I am confident that Sanofi now is much better positioned to deliver the sustained and long term growth that our shareholders are expecting from us,” he said.The company said in November 2015 its five-year strategic plan would see six key launches likely to generate peak sales of 12 billion to 14 billion euros by 2025.One of them, Dengvaxia, is proving disappointing after findings the vaccine could, in some cases, increase the risk of severe dengue in recipients not previously infected by the virus.Once touted as a $1 billion-a-year blockbuster product, Dengvaxia’s initial sales last year were only 55 million euros.Hurdles to patient access by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have also led to disappointing sales in Sanofi’s new cholesterol drug Praluent.“When I turn to delivering outstanding launches, I concede that our record over the past two years has been mixed,” Brandicourt said. “While we are not changing our ambition of combined peak sales, we are clearly much more reliant on our immunology franchise.”‘MULTI-TARGETING’In immunology, Sanofi has been concentrating on “multi-targeting” drugs that have the potential to treat more than one disease.One example is dupilumab, which was developed with U.S partner Regeneron and for which it has secured approval in the United States and Europe to treat eczema. The drug is also expected to have further uses in asthma, nasal polyps, eosinophilic esophagitis and food allergies.“Phase 3 development for dupilumab is now planned in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD),” Sanofi said.Sanofi, whose shares have underperformed major rivals, reiterated its strategy to rebuild its position in cancer and said it expected a first regulatory submission of its monoclonal antibody for relapsed refractory multiple myeloma in 2018.The drug will compete with Genmab’s and Johnson & Johnson’s (J&J) Darzalex which is already on the market.The Cancer Research Institute said last week the race to come up with new immunotherapy treatments for cancer had sparked an unprecedented expansion in the oncology drug pipeline, with more than 2,000 immune-system-boosting agents in development.The result is a scramble for patients to enrol in clinical trials, duplication of effort and the likely ultimate failure of many projects, according to experts.Asked if Sanofi had the means to pursue its strategy in multiple indications while some other players have opted to focus on niche products or key drugs, Brandicourt said Sanofi had made a clear choice to remain diversified.“There is no miracle recipe,” he said. “But given the risks in the industry, we came to the conclusion that being active in one therapeutic area only was dangerous.”"

2017-2-02,Amgen cholesterol drug succeeds in cutting serious heart problems -study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1FM1KC,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its potent cholesterol fighter Repatha significantly reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death in patients with heart disease, according to initial results of a large, eagerly-anticipated trial released on Thursday. The data should pave the way for greater acceptance by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who have been rejecting about 75 percent of prescriptions written for the expensive medicine despite multiple appeals by physicians.No new safety problems cropped up in the 27,500 patient study called Fourier, Amgen said. It also said Repatha’s effect on mental function was similar to placebo, likely alleviating concerns that it might impair cognition in some patients.The trial was widely expected to be positive, especially after a smaller study presented in November showed Repatha therapy led to regression of artery-clogging plaque, an underlying cause of heart disease.“These results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,” Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement.Details on the magnitude of benefit will be revealed in mid-March at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Washington, D.C. Industry analysts have been looking for a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction of major adverse heart events.Repatha, with a list price of more than $14,000 a year, was approved based on its ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in patients who require more intensive therapy on top of widely-used statins, such as Lipitor, or who are unable to tolerate statins.But those who control budgets wanted concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death before making it easier for patients to get the medicine.Repatha and a rival drug from Regeneron Corp and Sanofi have had endured anemic sales as a result.Amgen reported just $40 million in third-quarter sales. The company said Repatha would be well on its way to becoming a $1 billion seller if all prescriptions written had been filled.The primary and secondary goals of the study are composites of several adverse outcomes. At the heart meeting in March, researchers will also provide details on risk reduction for each of the components, such as non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death.The primary goal also included need for a new artery-clearing procedure and hospitalization for angina."

2017-2-07,Teva\'s new boss has bitter medicine to administer,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN15M13A,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - U.S. President Donald Trump has criticised drugmakers for getting away with murder. Israeli group Teva, which has lost its second chief executive in four years, looks guiltier of self-harm.The loss of its CEO comes at a bad time for the world’s largest generic drugmaker. Its core business of making copycat drugs is under attack in the United States, where inflated drug prices are under growing scrutiny. In January, the group lowered sales and earnings forecasts made just a year earlier in a sign of how quickly the landscape is changing.But Teva’s problems stretch well beyond political risk. While the company makes more than half of its money out of generics, its biggest revenue earner is its own treatment for multiple sclerosis, called Copaxone. Yet a court in January threw out a key patent that covers the drug and firms including Novartis are preparing to launch their own versions of the medicine. Two such copycat drugs could cut Copaxone revenues by a quarter and overall earnings by nearly 17 percent, based on Teva’s assumptions and Thomson Reuters Eikon data.There’s a playbook for getting out of trouble: bring in new management, cut costs, buy assets. None of these is easy. Deep cost cuts have already been made and Teva’s acquisitions history is patchy. Buying generics firm Actavis in 2015 now looks ill-timed and costly; a deal with Regeneron to develop treatment for back-pain is held up by safety concerns; and an acquisition of Mexican firm Rimsa resulted in a fraud spat. More deals would be risky and expensive when Teva’s debt is over three times EBITDA and its stock is depressed. One mooted idea, a breakup, would be a costly distraction right now.This puts a lot of pressure on Teva’s next chief to set a new course. And the talent poll may be limited because the company’s rules require the chief executive to live in Israel. One easy win may involve cutting the dividend. A dividend yield of more than 4 percent looks too high for a company with quite so many challenges. Teva’ depressed valuation of just 7 times forward earnings, half the pharma sector average, shows this may not be the only bitter medicine that lies ahead.On Twitter twitter.com/Unmack1"
2017-2-08,"Regeneron, Sanofi win stay of U.S. order blocking cholesterol drug sales",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1FT22V,"(Reuters) - A U.S. appeals court on Wednesday stayed an order that would have blocked Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA from selling their cholesterol drug, Praluent, while they appeal the order.A federal judge earlier had blocked sales of the drug after rival Amgen Inc won a trial in which it accused them of infringing its patents. The order would have taken effect on Feb. 21.Regeneron general counsel Joseph LaRosa said in a statement the company would continue to defend its case through the appeal process.“We continue to believe the facts and controlling law support our position in this case,” he said.Sanofi spokeswoman Ashleigh Koss said in an email the company was pleased the order had been stayed, “giving patients in the U.S. continued access to this important medicine during the appeal process.“It is our longstanding position that Amgen’s asserted patent claims are invalid,” she said.Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis said in an email that the company respected the court’s decision but was confident it would prevail against Regeneron and Sanofi’s appeal.Amgen was down 1.9 percent in after-hours trading. Regeneron was up 2.7 percent in after-hours trading and U.S.-traded shares of Sanofi were down 1.9 percent.Amgen had sought to block Praluent sales in an October 2014 lawsuit against Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron. It said Praluent, a drug intended to lower “bad” LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9, infringed its patents related to the protein.Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen makes a rival drug called Repatha.A jury found Amgen’s patents valid last March. U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Delaware, who presided over the case, granted a motion last month by Amgen to bar sales of Praluent.Regeneron and Sanofi petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to stay that order while they appealed. Multiple doctors submitted briefs in support of a stay, saying patients would be harmed if sales of Praluent were halted.The companies could still decide to reach a settlement that would give Amgen royalties on Praluent sales.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Praluent and Repatha to reduce bad cholesterol in 2015. The drugs are more costly than other cholesterol drugs, with a list price topping $14,000 annually."

2017-2-09,Regeneron pins hope on eczema drug as Eylea sales slow,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N1FU3U7,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer signaled that the U.S. biotech was on track to reduce its reliance on its flagship drug Eylea, as the company awaits the approval of two potential blockbuster treatments.Eylea has powered much of the company’s explosive growth since late 2011, but sales growth in the United States has slowed in recent quarters as the market saturates and competition heats up.Regeneron said on Thursday it expected single-digit percentage increase in U.S. net Eylea sales in 2017, while Wall Street is expecting an 11.3-12.9 percent rise, said Evercore ISI’s Mark Schoenebaum.Indicating the shift, the company said on a post-earnings call that this is the last year it will provide a separate forecast for the eye drug.Regeneron is betting on two key treatments - Dupixent for eczema and Sarilumab for rheumatoid arthritis - to diversify its revenue stream.A U.S. regulatory decision on Dupixent is expected by March, while the company hopes to resubmit a marketing application for sarilumab this quarter.Reimbursement discussions for Dupixent are encouraging, Schleifer said on the call.Schleifer also underscored Regeneron’s practice of not increasing Eylea prices, bucking the industry trend of raising prices on drugs twice a year, often by double digit percentages.“Price increases are nice, but if you cannot get them you better be able to innovate and that is our sweet spot,” he said.Other drugmakers, including AbbVie and Allergan, have responded to intense criticism over the high price of prescription medicines by vowing to take one increase a year of less than 10 percent.Regeneron’s shares rose as much as nearly 4 percent to $366.95.Tepid sales of Regeneron and Sanofi SA’s cholesterol-fighter Praluent and lower-than-expected collaboration revenue led to a narrow miss on quarterly revenue.Praluent - a potent but expensive injection - is yet to unlock its blockbuster potential as health insurers await evidence that the drug can reduce heart attacks.Amgen Inc has already announced positive heart data on its rival drug Repatha, while Regeneron’s trial results are expected later this year.Global Praluent sales were $41 million, well under analysts’ estimates of $57 million, and the $58 million Repatha generated.Regeneron and Sanofi suffered a huge setback in January after a federal judge banned Praluent sales, finding it infringed patents held by Amgen.But concerns were allayed on Wednesday, after a U.S. appeals court ruled that the companies can continue selling the drug, while they appeal the permanent injunction.Excluding items, Regeneron earned $3.04 per share, edging past the average analysts’ estimate by 1 cent, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue rose 11.7 percent to $1.23 billion, but missed estimates of $1.30 billion."

2017-2-15,Pharma industry shuns Trump push for radical shift at FDA,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN15U0GP,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s vow to roll back government regulations at least 75 percent is causing anxiety for some pharmaceutical executives that a less robust Food and Drug Administration would make it harder to secure insurance coverage for pricey new medicines.The prospect of big change at the regulatory agency comes as drugmakers are under fire for high prices, including Marathon Pharmaceuticals LLC, which said Monday it was “pausing” the launch of its Duchenne muscular dystrophy drug after U.S. lawmakers questioned its $89,000 a year price.Industry trade group Biotechnology Innovation Organization told Reuters that during high-level discussions with Trump advisors, lobbyists urged the administration not to name a new commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration who would act rashly to speed up the agency’s approval of new medicines.That sentiment was echoed by executives at more than a dozen pharmaceutical and biotechnology firms, who told Reuters that the FDA is already adopting new drug development models and warned that a looser review process would put patients at risk.“People often argue that the FDA is too restrictive,” said Roger Perlmutter, head of research and development at Merck & Co Inc. “We have the sense that the balance is pretty right ... you have to have a well-characterized risk/benefit profile.”That stance underscores the unique position the drug industry finds itself in when it comes to regulating its products. While most sectors welcome less oversight, drugmakers say a robust review process is critical in convincing physicians and insurers that a pricey new medicine has value.Otherwise, the time and money it takes to get a new drug to market - estimates run as high as $2.6 billion - would be lost if insurers are not willing to pay for the product.“It is great that the administration is seeking deregulation ... to make sure the private sector can be more competitive,” said John Maraganore, chief executive officer at Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc and co-chair of BIO’s regulatory committee. “But payers are looking for evidence of value.”He said the FDA should speed the approval of lower cost generic versions of drugs that have lost patent protection, but warned that allowing novel products to be launched without extensive testing could be dangerous.“Any change at the FDA that allows drugs to be tried out on patients without clinical evidence is a damaging approach,” said Jeremy Levin, chief executive officer at Ovid Therapeutics Inc., which is developing drugs for rare diseases.Health insurers are pushing back against high-priced drugs. Sales of expensive new cholesterol drugs from Amgen Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have stalled as insurers limit coverage until they see results of trials designed to prove that the drugs significantly lower the risk of heart attack and other cardiovascular crises.“It is one thing to get a drug approved, but you have got to get reimbursed,” said Paul Perreault, CEO at biotech company CSL Ltd, adding that won’t happen unless payers see proof that a new drug is better than what is already available.To be sure, some pharmaceutical executives have been vocal about the need for deregulation. Reducing regulation “will help with drug prices, because it will induce more competition,” Pfizer Inc CEO Ian Read said on a recent conference call.After top executives at Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others met at the White House last month with Trump, who pledged to “streamline” the FDA, industry trade group Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America said the meeting found common ground such as tax reform, and removal of outdated regulations. The trade group declined to comment on changes at the FDA.The prospect of a shake-up at the FDA is being welcomed by a new class of investor with ambitions to disrupt the current drug development model, in which larger pharmaceutical players often buy or license early-stage medicines, and reap the bigger rewards if they succeed.“The system we have now has its roots 50, 60 even 70 years ago ... it has become incredibly expensive,” said Tim Shannon, of venture capital firm Canaan Partners.He supports the notion that some prescription medications could reach the market, possibly at discounted prices, once testing shows they are safe. If such controlled usage indicates that they are also effective, prices could then be raised.“We want to make healthcare itself more efficient,” he said. “Let the marketplace decide how valuable a drug is.”The fate of deregulating the FDA will be driven by its next commissioner. President Trump said last month he has a “fantastic person” lined up for the role.Candidates, according to sources close to the administration, include former FDA staffer Scott Gottlieb, and Jim O’Neill, a colleague of Trump supporter Peter Thiel who has advocated for allowing some medicines to reach the market once they are shown to be safe, even if there is scant evidence that they work.A recent survey of drug company executives conducted by Mizuho Securities found that 72 percent said Gottlieb should be Trump’s pick to head the FDA.“There is no groundswell of movement for change,” said attorney Jim Shehan, head of Lowenstein Sandler’s FDA regulatory practice. “The industry likes certainty.”"

2017-3-13,Data on heart benefits of Amgen drug is key to unlocking sales,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1GM1AV,"(Reuters) - Data that should help unlock the sales potential of a potent new cholesterol medicine will be unveiled at the American College of Cardiology meeting this week as the future of the only rival drug rests with the courts in an ongoing patent dispute.Highly anticipated results from a 27,500-patient trial of Amgen Inc’s Repatha will be presented on Friday at the meeting in Washington, informing doctors and investors of just how much the expensive injectable drug cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and death in people with heart disease already taking maximum doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such as Lipitor.Insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been rejecting some 75 percent of prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof of their clinical value. They prefer to keep patients on cheap, generic statins already shown to prevent heart attacks.Repatha and a competing drug, Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA , have list prices of over $14,000 a year, before discounts and rebates.They belong to a class of medicines called PCSK9 inhibitors that were approved on their ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol. But with a raging debate over high U.S. prescription drug prices, there has been pressure for hard data to justify the cost of medicines that may have to be taken for life.The high rejection rate has severely constrained sales of the potential multibillion-dollar products, which were just $58 million for Repatha and $41 million for Praluent in the fourth quarter.Rejections have frustrated cardiologists trying to get these new drugs for patients whose cholesterol remains dangerously high despite taking the most potent statins, and for those unable to tolerate them.“What I care about is there are patients for whom the PCSK9 is absolutely vital,” said Dr. Leslie Cho, head of preventive cardiology and cardiac rehabilitation at the Cleveland Clinic.Industry analysts said they hope to see at least a 20 percent reduction of major adverse heart events from Repatha, and that anything less might be viewed as disappointing to investors.Dr. Jorge Plutzky, director of the vascular disease prevention program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said a risk reduction greater than 20 percent would be very hard for insurers to ignore. But, he added, “any statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular events would be important to me.”Amgen shares rose 3 percent last month, when it announced the Repatha trial had succeeded without providing details.Regeneron expects to have results from Praluent’s large cardiovascular outcomes trial by year end. Whether Praluent will still be available depends on an appeal of a U.S. court ruling that found it infringed Repatha patents.Praluent was allowed to remain on the market pending the appeal decision, which could take into account the benefit to society of competition that lowers drug prices.New prescriptions have been higher for Repatha since the January court ruling. In the week ended March 3, there were 1,288 written for Repatha and 892 for Praluent, according to data reported by analysts.But interviews with physicians found they were not taking Praluent’s uncertain future into account when selecting which to prescribe.Those decisions were driven by preferences of individual patients’ health insurer or PBM, they said.

2017-3-14,UK gives early green light to Sanofi eczema drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N1GR1WU,"LONDON, March 14 (Reuters) - Sanofi has won an early green light from Britain for its game-changing eczema medicine, boosting the French company’s hopes for a product that is also expected to win approval in the U.S. market this month.Britain’s medicines regulator has granted dupilumab a positive scientific opinion through its Early Access to Medicines Scheme, meaning patients can get the drug before it is granted formal marketing authorisation, Sanofi said on Tuesday.Dupilumab has impressed doctors in a series of clinical trials over the past year and consensus analyst forecasts already point to annual global sales of more than $4 billion by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters data.The medicine, which was developed with Sanofi’s long-time partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is widely expected to win a U.S. green light by a March 29 action date set by the Food and Drug Administration.Dupilumab works by inhibiting two proteins involved in the body’s immune response, known as IL-4 and IL-13, giving it an unusually wide range of potential uses. Beyond eczema, or atopic dermatitis, Sanofi believes it has the potential to help fight 14 different disorders, including asthma and food allergies.Sanofi’s research head, Elias Zerhouni, told Reuters last week he had very high hopes for the medicine, which he said signalled “the emergence of the new science and portfolio at Sanofi”.The Paris-based group needs to score some high-profile wins on the new drug front to offset flagging sales in its big diabetes business, where increasing competition and pressure on prices has hit sales and profits.

2017-3-17,"Amgen discounts cholesterol drug, but payers want more",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1GU23H,"(Adds Medicine Co CEO comment on price)March 17 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc sells its cholesterol-lowering drug Repatha at a discount of about 30 percent to its U.S. list price of $14,000 a year, but the largest pharmacy benefit managers say they want lower prices after new data suggested more patients should be treated with the drug.Amgen, which on Friday presented data showing for the first time that Repatha cuts the risk of heart attack and stroke , said in a related presentation for investors that it is netting between $7,700 to $11,200 per annual treatment after discounts and rebates and believes those prices represent good value.Sean Harper, head of research and development at Amgen, told Reuters that current industry discounts average 30 percent to 35 percent.“I think responsibly, if the number you are treating goes up and you are trying to recoup the cost of (developing) the drug ... one would hope that the price would go down,” said Troyen Brennan, chief medical officer at CVS Health Corp, the No. 2 manager of drug benefit plans for U.S. employers and insurers.He expects the new data to widen eligibility for the treatment from roughly 1 million to at least 4 million Americans.Steve Miller, CMO at Express Scripts, the nation’s largest pharmacy benefit manager, told Reuters he is “really focused on value-based pricing” and is “hopeful for additional improvements” in contract terms. Conversations about CVS’s contracts for Amgen’s drug and competitor Praluent, which is sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA , are under way, he said.Amgen said it plans to offer additional contracting options, including refunding the cost of the drug for patients who suffer a heart attack or stroke, but emphasized that it believes current prices are fair.“In fact, they may even be below the value-based range for the types of patients getting access now,” said Joshua Ofman, senior vice president of global value, access and policy at Amgen. “We want to engage payers in risk-sharing contracts. If the drug does not perform, net prices will go down. But if the drug performs as we expect, they will not.”Repatha, approved by regulators in 2015, belongs to a class of injected antibody drugs that target PCSK9, a protein that maintains “bad” LDL cholesterol in the blood. It is aimed at the millions of people who don’t benefit from statins.Statin pills, like Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, work very differently, blocking the liver’s production of LDL cholesterol, and cost only about $100 per year. Around one in four Americans age 45 and older is taking a statin.Wall Street analysts have forecast that annual sales of Repatha and Praluent, which also has a list price near $14,000, could reach into the billions, but sales so far have been underwhelming as health providers and payers awaited evidence of improvement in cardiovascular risk. Sales of Repatha totaled $141 million last year.The Medicines Co plans later this year to begin enrolling patients in a pivotal study of its experimental drug inclisiran, which is also designed to block PCSK9.Chief Executive Clive Meanwell said Medicines Co will seek a price based on the value of the drug and risk level of the patient, suggesting it would fall between $2,000 and $8,500 a year.Amgen executives said the new Repatha trial results will clear the way for more patients to get access to the drug.“Access restrictions have been a real challenge for patients and their providers,” said Ofman. He added that groups like the American Medical Association and the American College of Cardiology are beginning to play a larger role in working with payers to make sure drug utilization criteria are appropriate.CVS’s Brennan said he would be waiting to hear from these groups about which patients should get the drug.

2017-3-17,"Amgen cholesterol drug cuts heart attack, stroke risk more than 20 pct-study",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1GR0T2,"WASHINGTON, March 17 (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s Repatha drug cut the risk of heart attacks and strokes by over 20 percent in patients with heart disease, demonstrating a clear clinical benefit beyond its ability to slash “bad” LDL cholesterol levels, data from a huge study known as Fourier showed on Friday.Results from the highly anticipated 27,564-patient Fourier study should help remove some barriers to patient access from health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who have been rejecting some 75 percent of prescriptions written for the costly medicine.Repatha cut the combined risk of heart attacks, strokes and heart-related death by 20 percent compared with a placebo in patients already on high doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such at Lipitor. Most trial subjects had had a prior heart attack or stroke.Separately, Repatha cut heart attacks by 27 percent and stroke by 21 percent. In the second year of the study, the results were more pronounced, with a 35 percent reduction in heart attack risk and a 24 percent decrease in stroke risk.“Just like in statin trials the benefit appeared to grow over time,” said Dr. Marc Sabatine, the study’s lead researcher, who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in Washington.“As a clinician this is very big news. We have another tool to significantly reduce heart attacks and stokes. That’s a big win,” said Sabatine from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.There was no difference in cardiovascular death in the two groups, which may disappoint some investors. Researchers said that may be due in part to the study’s length, with a median duration of 26 months.Longer term, Sabatine said, there could be a reduction in deaths as well.The trial’s primary composite goal included need for artery clearing procedures and hospitalization due to chest pains from angina in addition to heart attack, stroke and death. On that measure, the overall risk reduction was 15 percent, primarily due to no difference from placebo in angina hospitalizations.Repatha, injected either once or twice a month, lowered LDL by about 60 percent to a median of 30, with a quarter of patients getting below 20, researchers reported. Earlier guidelines set an LDL target of 70 for such high risk patients.There were no reports concerning safety issues. Incidence of cognitive decline, cataracts, new onset diabetes and muscle-related side effects were similar to the placebo group.The results should loosen the purse strings of insurers reluctant to pay for a drug with a list price of over $14,000 a year before discounts, given the high cost of treating strokes and heart attacks.“To see a more than 20 percent risk reduction for stroke was really exciting,” said Amgen research chief Sean Harper.Amgen said it is taking steps to remove onerous barriers to patient access, including a plan under which it would offer to refund Repatha costs for all eligible patients who have a heart attack or stroke.Repatha and rival Praluent, from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, work by blocking the PCSK9 protein that prevents LDL being removed from the blood.“The class is likely to grow to at least a $3 billion to $5 billion worldwide market over the next 5 plus years,” forecast RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee.Due to the high rejection rate, sales have been anemic - just $58 million for Repatha and $41 million for Praluent in the fourth quarter.Sabatine said he would like to see Repatha tested in other high risk patients, such as those with type 2 diabetes without prior history of heart attack, which could substantially increase the market.“As a society we need to move to modifying these risk factors earlier in life to not only prevent recurrent events but to prevent first events,” he said.

2017-3-17,Medicines Co drug shows long-term cholesterol lowering in study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1GT267,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A long-acting new type of drug being developed by Medicines Co cut levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol in half in high-risk heart patients with no serious safety issues, according to data from a Phase II trial presented on Friday.The company said it plans to begin enrolling patients in a pivotal Phase III study for the drug, inclisiran, later this year.Despite the positive results, Medicine Co shares fell 14.6 percent after highly-anticipated data from Amgen Inc’s rival drug Repatha failed to reach investor expectations for how much it cut the risk of serious adverse heart events in data presented earlier on Friday at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) scientific meeting in Washington.Inclisiran belongs to a new class of medicines that block a protein known as PCSK9, which prevents the removal of LDL from the blood. But the Medicines Co drug works in a different way than the two already on the market, utilizing a technology known as RNA interference, or RNAi, that blocks PCSK9 production at its source in the liver.After an initial injection of 300 milligrams of inclisiran and another three months later, the drug is designed to be taken just twice a year. Repatha and Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi are injected either every two or four weeks.Aside from the convenience of far fewer injections, Medicines Co is planning to make the drug significantly less expensive than its rivals, if approved.Chief Executive Clive Meanwell said the company will seek a price based on the value of the drug and risk level of the patient, suggesting it would fall between $2,000 and $8,500 a year. Repatha and Praluent cost more than $14,000 a year before discounts and rebates.Medicines Co licensed inclisiran from AlnylamPharmaceuticals, which would be entitled to royalty payments on future sales.In the 9-month study of 497 patients, most already on cholesterol-lowering statins, two doses of inclisiran reduced LDL by up to 53 per cent. Nearly half the patients saw LDL levels fall below 50, well below the common target of 70 for patients at high risk of a heart attack or stroke.“This is a game changer,” said Dr. Kausik Ray, who presented the data at the ACC meeting.“You have a treatment regimen that gives you on average, with an initial starting dosing regimen, a 50 percent (LDL) reduction through to nine months,” said Ray. “That’s unheard of.”"
2017-3-21,"Sanofi, Regeneron sue Amgen to protect eczema drug from patent claims",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN16S24F,"BOSTON (Reuters) - Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have filed a lawsuit seeking a court order declaring that their eczema drug Dupixent, awaiting a U.S. approval decision, does not infringe an Amgen Inc patent for a failed asthma treatment.The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Boston on Monday, was intended to preempt one expected to be brought by Amgen, which has previously sued Sanofi and Regeneron over their rival cholesterol drug Praluent.“Sanofi and Regeneron wish to eliminate any potential obstacle Amgen might seek to raise against the planned U.S. commercialization of Dupixent,” the plaintiffs said in the lawsuit.Amgen said in a statement on Tuesday that the company “does have a patent covering the product and we will defend our patent rights.”The suit came two months after a federal judge in Delaware blocked Sanofi and Regeneron from selling Praluent because it was found to infringe Amgen’s Repatha patent. Praluent was allowed to remain on the market during the appeals process.Sanofi and Regeneron argue they have spent hundreds of millions of dollars developing Dupixent.The injectable drug, known chemically as dupilumab, is seen as a critically important future growth driver for both companies, with annual sales forecast to exceed $5 billion by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters data.The companies have called Dupixent a “game-changer” in moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, a type of eczema that causes extreme itching. The lawsuit said plans were under way to begin selling Dupixent as soon as it wins approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a decision due next week.The patent at issue in the lawsuit was issued to Amgen in the 2000s, when it was attempting to develop an asthma treatment. Amgen abandoned development of the drug following disappointing results, the lawsuit said.The complaint said that in recent days lawyers for Sanofi and Regeneron learned Amgen had hired lawyers to pursue patent infringement litigation related to Amgen’s work on that treatment. Dupilumab is also being tested for asthma and other indications.“We took this proactive step to protect the value of our innovative therapy Dupixent and ensure access of this important medicine for physicians and patients,” Sanofi said in a statement on Tuesday.The case is Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC et al v. Amgen Inc et al, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 17-cv-10465."

2017-3-22,"GSK and Regeneron to mine gene data from 500,000 Britons",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N1GZ4H7,"LONDON (Reuters) - Britain’s GlaxoSmithKline and U.S.-based Regeneron Pharmaceuticals are embarking on a joint project with UK Biobank, the world’s most detailed biomedical database, to hunt for new clues linking genes and disease.By analyzing genetic variations and health in 500,000 middle-aged and older Britons, the partners said on Thursday they hoped to identify promising leads for new medicines.The aim is to analyze DNA from an initial 50,000 samples by the end of 2017, using Regeneron’s large gene sequencing center in New York. Completing a gene sweep for all 500,000 participants is expected to take three to five years.The move marks an acceleration of investment by drugmakers in genetic science, as industrial-scale sequencing and falling costs allow research teams to quickly test for the effect of gene variations across thousands of individuals.GSK’s British rival AstraZeneca signed a similar deal with genome pioneer Craig Venter a year ago to sequence genes from up to 2 million people over 10 years.Volunteers aged between 40 and 69 first checked into the UK Biobank between 2006 and 2010, donating blood and other biological samples and agreeing to have their health followed through medical records over many years.Lon Cardon, head of target sciences at GSK R&D, said the database was now coming into its own as an information source as growing numbers of participants start to develop conditions from cancer to dementia, which can be cross-checked against genes.GSK and Regeneron will get nine months exclusivity to pore over the initial trawl of data before the information is made openly available to other scientists. Any research findings will also be put back into the public domain.Both drug companies hope the information throws up new opportunities for drug development, but they view the exercise as “pre-competitive”.Apart from paying the cost of sample retrieval and shipping, GSK and Regeneron will not be charged by UK Biobank. Instead, they will effectively make a “payment in kind” by sequencing the DNA for future use by the wider scientific community.Sequencing all the protein-encoding parts of all the genes from the project’s 500,000 participants will cost an estimated $150 million. Such so-called exome sequencing costs about $300 per individual, against $1,000 for whole genome sequencing.All the genetic and other medical data collected by UK Biobank has been anonymized and participants will not get any feedback on their individual circumstances."
2017-3-23,"Crunch week looms for Sanofi, Roche and GSK at U.S. drugs agency",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N1GY3V4,"LONDON (Reuters) - Three of Europe’s top drugmakers face critical verdicts from U.S. regulators next week, with Sanofi and Roche likely to win approvals for two new products, while GlaxoSmithKline braces for a potential generic rival.Given earlier impressive clinical trial results, investors expect the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to clear both Roche’s multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment Ocrevus and Sanofi’s new eczema drug Dupixent.The two FDA decisions, due by March 28 and 29 respectively, mark important landmarks for both firms, since Dupixent and Ocrevus are expected to be the biggest new drug launches from the global pharmaceuticals industry in 2017.Dupixent, developed with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, is forecast to sell $4.2 billion annually by 2022, with Ocrevus seen hitting $4 billion by that time, according to the consensus of analysts’ estimates compiled by Thomson Reuters.Sanofi’s research head says Dupixent marks a new era of successful innovation for the French company, although the product is tied up in a patent dispute with Amgen.The remarkable success of Ocrevus against two types of MS, meanwhile, will help Roche diversify beyond cancer. The drug has beaten rivals in fighting relapsing remitting MS and could become the only approved drug for primary progressive MS.The picture is a lot less certain for Britain’s GSK as it faces the threat of cut-price competition from Mylan, which hopes to secure approval for the first substitutable generic copy of GSK’s top-selling Advair lung drug by March 28.Mylan believes it has done everything required to win FDA approval but its version of Advair would be the first complex inhaled combination generic product to be approved by the U.S. agency, so nothing is guaranteed.That complexity has led some analysts to question whether Mylan will succeed at its first attempt to gain approval, potentially delaying the arrival of generics and shielding GSK’s profits from immediate attack.A second generic version of Advair from Hikma Pharmaceuticals and Vectura is also awaiting an FDA approval decision by May 10.Dealing with the threat of competition to Advair, which has generated more than $1 billion in annual sales since 2001, is the first big challenge facing GSK’s new chief executive, Emma Walmsley, who takes over at the end of this month.GSK has told the market that core earnings per share, in constant currencies, will be flat to slightly lower in 2017, if substitutable Advair generics arrive in the United States by mid-year. If they don’t launch, EPS should rise between 5 and 7 percent."

2017-3-28,"FDA approves Regeneron, Sanofi $37,000 per year eczema drug",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1H512O,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA’s drug for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, a product widely seen as the most important future growth driver for the two companies.Sanofi and Regeneron said the drug, Dupixent, will have a list price of $37,000 a year. But while the price before discounts and rebates to insurers is far more expensive than topical medicines and steroids currently used to treat eczema, it is less pricey than other injectable antibody drugs for serious conditions, such as psoriasis, that list for about $50,000 a year.“We are encouraged by the ongoing conversations we’ve had with health plans and pharmacy benefit managers about coverage for Dupixent for patients,” Sanofi said in a statement.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type of skin inflammation also known as eczema, which in severe cases causes constant, often unbearable, itching.Wall Street analysts forecast annual sales exceeding $4 billion by 2022 for the biotech drug known chemically as dupilumab, according to Thomson Reuters data.Dupilumab had earned the FDA’s breakthrough therapy designation given to expedite development and review of medicines for serious or life-threatening diseases lacking effective treatments.“This drug is really a game changer,” said Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky, Vice Chair of the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York who conducted clinical trials of dupilumab.“This condition is terrible for patients. They don’t sleep at night. It’s like having poison ivy all the time all over the body,” she said, adding that patients lose work and can become so desperate they contemplate suicide.Dupixent is also being developed for severe asthma, where it will compete with a wave of other new biotech medicines, such as GlaxoSmithKline’s Nucala, as well as for nasal polyps.The drug works by blocking the IL-4 and IL-13 proteins involved in the body’s immune response that Regeneron and Sanofi believe to be underlying causes of a number of complex conditions.In a pivotal late stage study, after 16 weeks of treatment with 300 milligrams of Dupixent either weekly or every two weeks along with topical corticosteroids, 39 percent had achieved clear or nearly clear skin compared with 12 percent of patients who received the topical treatment alone.Eczema affects an estimated 2 percent of U.S. adults, and as many as 10 percent to 20 percent of children. About a third of adults have moderate to severe disease.Regeneron and Sanofi shares were up less than 1 percent each after the widely expected approval announcement."

(bit.ly/2p00FDy)Sarilumab, the active substance of Kevzara, a treatment for adult patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, works by blocking a protein called IL-6, which is associated with inflammation.The panel’s opinion will now be reviewed by the EMA.In October, U.S. regulators declined to approve sarilumab because of manufacturing deficiencies at a Sanofi plant in France.Regeneron said in February that it was planning to resubmit a marketing application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for sarilumab.The drug has already been approved by Canadian health regulators to treat rheumatoid arthritis.More than 23 million people worldwide suffer from rheumatoid arthritis. Current treatments include the widely used methotrexate as well as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Other IL-6 inhibitors for rheumatoid arthritis include Roche Holding AG’s approved Actemra and Johnson & Johnson’s experimental sirukumab.Last Friday, the FDA declined to approve a new rheumatoid arthritis drug, Olumiant, made by Eli Lilly and Co and partner Incyte Corp."

2017-4-28,"Sanofi beats profit forecasts, upbeat on prospects for eczema drug",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1I0101,"(Adds shares, quote background)PARIS, April 28 (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi’s profit beat forecasts in the first quarter and confirmed its earnings outlook for the year, lifting its shares on Friday.The results were buoyed by Sanofi’s speciality care division Genzyme, as well as vaccines and consumer products it has acquired from Germany’s Boehringer Ingelheim.Earlier this year, Sanofi had warned investors it expected 2017 earnings per share to be stable or slightly lower after its fourth quarter results were affected by an increase in taxes and one-off charges.The company had also said in 2015 it was not targeting any ‘meaningful’ profit growth for two years, citing difficulties in its embattled diabetes division.“Although it has now some margin to deliver actual numbers above guidance, Sanofi also has reasons to wait a bit more before raising it. Diabetes is still a very uncertain market segment to work in,” Bryan Garnier analysts said in a note.However, Sanofi, whose shares were up more than 2 percent at 0805 GMT, said it was confident Dupixent, a drug for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis that was approved in the United States at the end of last month, would sell well.Analysts forecast annual Dupixent sales of more than $4 billion by 2022, according to Thomson Reuters data. Developed with Regeneron, the drug is seen as the most important growth driver for the two companies, who have said Dupixent will have a list price of $37,000 a year.Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt told journalists that he was “very encouraged with the early coverage” of Dupixent, adding that “the launch is delivering so far exactly on our expectations”.While the price of Dupixent before discounts and rebates to insurers is far more expensive than topical medicines and steroids used to treat eczema, it is less expensive than other injectable antibody drugs for serious skin conditions, such as psoriasis, that list for about $50,000 a year.Sanofi said on Friday first-quarter business net income rose 1 percent at constant exchange rates to 1.8 billion euros ($1.95 billion). Total sales rose 8.6 percent to 8.65 billion.Analysts polled by Reuters in partnership with Inquiry Financial had on average been expecting business net profit of 1.6 billion euros and net sales of 8.38 billion.Genzyme’s sales were up 15.5 percent while revenue at the vaccines divisions rose 22.2 percent. Consumer healthcare products sales were up 42.7 percent.Hurt by continued U.S. pricing pressure, diabetes and cardiovascular sales however suffered another downturn with revenue falling 7.7 percent.

2017-5-04,"As Eylea fears fade, focus turns to Regeneron\'s eczema drug",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N1I64P5,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O said its eczema drug Dupixent was off to a strong start and the biotech stood by its full-year sales forecast for its flagship drug Eylea even as competition heats up.The company’s shares jumped nearly 6 percent to $430.93 on Thursday.Regeneron is betting on two key treatments – sarilumab, to treat rheumatoid arthritis, and Dupixent – to reduce its reliance on Eylea, which accounts for nearly 70 percent of total revenue.Dupixent was approved in late March to treat severe atopic dermatitis and about 3,500 prescriptions for it have been written so far, Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said on a post-earnings call.That was substantially higher than the 2,500 prescriptions partner Sanofi SA SASY.PA reported last week, Jefferies Biren Amin said. He lifted his estimate for Dupixent's 2017 sales by fourfold to $144 million. Regeneron also said two of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefits managers have agreed to cover Dupixent and the drug is well positioned to secure broad coverage by the end of 2017.Dupixent, also being tested for an allergic inflammatory condition of the esophagus, costs about $37,000 and is expected to generate peak annual sales of more than $4 billion.Regeneron also said it was gearing up for the launch of sarilumab, after the FDA decides on the drug, expected by May 22.Eylea has powered much of the company's growth since late 2011. However, the drug's sales growth has slowed in recent quarters, mainly due to competition from Roche AG's ROG.S Lucentis.U.S. sales of Eylea rose 9 percent in the first quarter – in line with Regeneron’s expectations that growth would slow to the single-digit percentage range this year from the double-digit growth enjoyed since the drug was launched in 2011.But the quarterly sales of $854 million was just shy of analysts’ estimates due to inventory destocking and greater discounting.Sales of Regeneron’s cholesterol fighter Praluent were $36 million in the quarter, well short of estimates of $62 million, which the company blamed on an ongoing lawsuit.However, total revenue rose to $1.32 billion, edging past analysts' estimate of $1.30 billion, due to strong collaboration revenue from partners Sanofi and Bayer BAYGn.DE.Net income jumped 37.2 percent to $248.9 million.

The estimated profit growth of 14.2 percent is the strongest growth since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Tesla was down 4.7 percent to $296.46 after the electric-car maker posted a bigger-than-expected loss.Viacom fell 5.4 percent to $37.12 on a softening advertisement market and news that Charter Communications has re-tiered five of Viacom’s flagship networks.Regeneron rose 5.7 percent to $430.44 after the biotech company’s revenue edged past analysts’ estimates.Declining issues outnumbered advancers on the NYSE by 2,062 to 825. On the Nasdaq, 1,692 issues fell and 1,068 advanced.The S&P 500 index showed 38 new 52-week highs and 12 new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 87 new highs and 60 new lows.

2017-5-04,Wall Street ends flat as health bill passes; energy slammed,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1801C0,"(Reuters) - Wall Street ended flat on Thursday as a steep fall for the energy sector countered some solid earnings reports, with major stock indexes closing little changed after the U.S. House of Representatives passed a healthcare overhaul.The House on Thursday afternoon narrowly voted to repeal major portions of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, and replace it with a Republican healthcare plan, sending it to the Senate for consideration.The bill’s passage comes after House Republicans pulled healthcare legislation earlier this year in a setback, raising questions among investors about President Donald Trump’s ability to enact his agenda.The benchmark S&P 500 has gained 11.7 percent since Trump’s election, fueled by his plans for tax cuts, infrastructure spending and deregulation.“The real risk in the near term to the so-called Trump rally was a failure to pass it,” said Rick Meckler, president of LibertyView Capital Management in Jersey City, New Jersey.“I don’t know if this market is really that focused on healthcare as the big issue,” Meckler said. “I think they’re really focused on the tax plan. If they couldn’t pass the healthcare, it would bode very poorly for the tax plan.”The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 6.43 points, or 0.03 percent, to 20,951.47, the S&P 500 gained 1.39 points, or 0.06 percent, to 2,389.52 and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.79 points, or 0.05 percent, to 6,075.34.The energy sector dropped 1.9 percent, easily the worst performing group. Exxon Mobil’s 1.3-percent decline and Chevron’s 1.8-percent drop weighed on the S&P.Oil prices tumbled about 5 percent on signs that OPEC and other producing countries would not take more drastic steps to reduce the world’s stubbornly persistent glut of crude.Investors also were digesting the Federal Reserve’s statement on Wednesday. The central bank left rates unchanged but downplayed weak first-quarter economic growth while emphasizing the strong labor market, in a sign it was still on track for two more rate rises this year.Focus was turning to Friday’s U.S. employment report as the next gauge of the economy and labor market. Data on Thursday showed new applications for U.S. jobless benefits fell sharply last week and the number of Americans on unemployment rolls hit a 17-year low.“It’s going to be particularly important to see if we get the expected rebound in job gains,” given that the Fed discounted the first quarter growth weakness because of a projected recovery, said Alan Gayle, director of asset allocation at RidgeWorth Investments in Atlanta.“Now the market is going to be watching very carefully to see whether or not they get that confirming data that would mean we will get a June rate increase,” Gayle said.In corporate news, Tesla fell 5 percent after the electric automaker’s quarterly net loss widened.In the healthcare sector, Regeneron rose 6.7 percent and Zoetis rose 5.9 percent after their respective results.Earnings season has come in generally above expectations, encouraging investors. First-quarter profits at S&P 500 companies are estimated to have increased 14.8 percent, the strongest since 2011, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Declining issues outnumbered advancing ones on the NYSE by a 1.79-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 1.17-to-1 ratio favored decliners.The S&P 500 posted 49 new 52-week highs and 13 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 104 new highs and 77 new lows.About 7.8 billion shares changed hands in U.S. exchanges, well above the 6.6 billion daily average over the last 20 sessions."

2017-5-09,Sanofi pegs U.S. drug price rises to below healthcare inflation,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1IB4DH,"(Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA has pledged to peg U.S. drug price rises to below healthcare inflation in a move that limits increases for any product this year to 5.4 percent, unless there are exceptional circumstances.The price promise goes one step beyond action taken by a number of other large pharmaceutical companies that have undertaken to keep 2017 price increases below 10 percent.Drugmakers are under fire worldwide over prices as a wave of new treatments for cancer and other serious conditions reach the market, some costing tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars per patient.The row is particularly fierce in the United States, where prices are higher than in Europe and where there have been highly publicised increases in some older products, such as Mylan's MYL.O EpiPen for allergic reactions.The complex U.S. supply chain has led to a blame game between drugmakers, health insurers and intermediaries known as pharmacy benefit managers.“This complexity is undermining the reputation of an entire industry whose purpose is to make a positive change in patients’ lives,” Sanofi Chief Executive Olivier Brandicourt said.Sanofi will take as its pricing benchmark the national health expenditures (NHE) growth projection, which is calculated by the Department of Health and Human Services and covers spending by all U.S. payers, including individuals.“By limiting our price increases to the NHE growth projection, we ensure that Sanofi is not contributing to further medical inflation,” Brandicourt said.This would cap price increases for any product to 5.4 percent in 2017, but Sanofi said there might be times when there was a “sound reason” for a higher increase, in which case it promised to demonstrate publicly the rationale for such a rise.Sanofi said it would disclose the gross and net prices for its medicines in future, adding that in 2016 its average aggregate list prices increased by 4.0 percent but net prices fell by 2.1 percent.Other companies, including Merck & Co MRK.N and Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N, have also released gross and net prices. But the picture is particularly stark for Sanofi, which is being hit hard by competition in its core diabetes treatment business.The competition is driving down its prices, notably for its long-lasting insulin Lantus.Responding to criticism about high drug prices, other firms such as AbbVie ABBV.N, Allergan AGN.N, Novo Nordisk NOVOb.CO and Takeda Pharmaceutical 4502.T have promised to keep all drug price increases in 2017 in single digits.Sanofi believes pegging prices to an independent measure like the NHE is more objective and less arbitrary than such a single-digit promise.The NHE is currently projected to increase by an average 5.6 percent annually between now and 2025. NHE inflation has generally hovered around the mid-single digits level, with the increase hitting a historic low of 2.9 percent in 2013.In the past, Sanofi has received mixed reviews for its drug pricing.The company surprised many investors in March when it set a lower-than-expected price for its new injectable eczema drug Dupixent, developed with long-time partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O.But it has been accused by a group of patients of colluding with rivals over diabetes drug prices going back several years. Sanofi denies the charge."
2017-5-22,Severe asthma drug shows AstraZeneca promise beyond cancer,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1IO46I,"LONDON, May 22 (Reuters) - AstraZeneca’s experimental injection for severe asthma cut substantially the need for patients to take problematic oral steroids drugs in a late-stage study, boosting hopes for a medicine that is expected to reach the market later this year.Benralizumab will compete with GlaxoSmithKline’s Nucala and Teva’s Cinqair - two other new antibody drugs for severe asthma - but AstraZeneca believes its product’s potency and convenient dosing could give it an edge.While most investor focus is on AstraZeneca’s cancer research, particularly the immunotherapy drug durvalumab , the company also has a long history in respiratory therapy that it plans to build on with benralizumab.Data from the 28-week Phase III clinical trial presented at the American Thoracic Society on Monday showed the median reduction in oral steroid dose was 75 percent for patients on benralizumab.Overall, patients treated with benralizumab were more than four times as likely to cut steroid use than those on placebo and there was also a 70 percent reduction in the rate of serious asthma attacks, known as exacerbations.However, around 20 percent of benralizumab patients did not have a reduction in oral steroid use, for reasons that researchers said were unclear.Tom Keith-Roach, head of AstraZeneca’s respiratory, inflammation and autoimmune business, said the results were good news for the sickest patients, who currently rely on oral steroids that cause weight gain, mood changes and other side effects.AstraZeneca has previously flagged benralizumab as a potential $2 billion-a-year seller - a prediction made at the time of Pfizer’s unsuccessful attempt to acquire the British company in 2014.Industry analysts are more cautious, with consensus forecasts pointing to annual sales of $915 million in 2023, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.In addition to competition from GSK and Teva, benralizumab also faces a potentially serious challenge from Sanofi and Regeneron, whose drug dupilumab is being tested for severe asthma after winning a green light in eczema.Benralizumab works by directly killing off inflammatory cells found in the lungs called eosinophils and, unlike the two existing drugs, it is given only every eight weeks rather than monthly.“There are around 2 million severe uncontrolled asthmatics worldwide in our top 12 markets and I certainly think based on this profile we would expect to have a really competitive share of that market,” Keith-Roach said.Data from the latest trial, along with results from two earlier studies, were included in regulatory submissions for benralizumab in various countries, including the United States, where an approval decision is due in the fourth quarter.The full results of the steroid-sparing study were also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

2017-5-23,AstraZeneca asthma shot hits goal but diabetes drug lags rival,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN18I2CC,"LONDON (Reuters) - AstraZeneca’s experimental injection for severe asthma cut substantially the need for patients to take problematic oral steroid drugs in a late-stage study, boosting hopes for a medicine that is expected to reach the market later this year.But the British drugmaker’s established Bydureon medicine for diabetes failed to show a hoped-for benefit in reducing heart risks, putting it at a disadvantage to Novo Nordisk’s rival Victoza in the so-called GLP-1 drug class.Novo’s next-generation GLP-1 drug semaglutide, currently awaiting approval, has also shown such a heart benefit.The mixed news left AstraZeneca’s shares little changed in early dealings on Tuesday.While most investor focus is on AstraZeneca’s cancer research, particularly the immunotherapy drug durvalumab, the company also has a long history in respiratory therapy and a significant presence in diabetes.It plans to build on the lung expertise with new asthma drug benralizumab, which will compete with GlaxoSmithKline’s Nucala and Teva’s Cinqair - two other recently approved antibody drugs for severe asthma.AstraZeneca hopes its product’s potency and convenient dosing will give it an edge, despite being third to market.Data from the 28-week Phase III clinical trial presented at the American Thoracic Society and published in the New England Journal of Medicine on Monday showed the median reduction in oral steroid dose was 75 percent for patients on benralizumab.Overall, patients treated with benralizumab were more than four times as likely to cut steroid use than those on placebo and there was also a 70 percent reduction in the rate of serious asthma attacks, known as exacerbations.Tom Keith-Roach, head of AstraZeneca’s respiratory, inflammation and autoimmune business, said the results were good news for the sickest patients, who currently rely on oral steroids that can cause weight gain, mood changes and other side effects.Data from the latest trial, along with results from two earlier studies, were included in regulatory submissions for benralizumab in various countries, including the United States, where an approval decision is due in the fourth quarter.The picture was less favorable for Bydureon, where a separate clinical trial showed that while the injectable drug did not raise heart dangers, it failed to demonstrate a statistically significant reduction in cardiovascular risks.Consensus industry analyst forecasts point to annual benralizumab sales of $915 million in 2023, while Bydureon is expected to sell $854 million, according to data compiled by Thomson Reuters.In addition to competition from GSK and Teva, benralizumab also faces a potentially serious challenge from Sanofi and Regeneron, whose drug dupilumab is being tested for severe asthma after winning a green light in eczema.Benralizumab works by directly killing off inflammatory cells found in the lungs called eosinophils and, unlike the two existing drugs, it is given only every eight weeks rather than monthly.“There are around 2 million severe uncontrolled asthmatics worldwide in our top 12 markets and I certainly think based on this profile we would expect to have a really competitive share of that market,” Keith-Roach said."

2017-5-24,"Molecular Partners CEO considers partners, capital hike to boost cash",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN18K0XV,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Molecular Partners MOLN.S could sell more shares or seek a partner for one of its pipeline assets to refill the Swiss biotechnology company's coffers by 2019, Chief Executive Patrick Amstutz told Reuters. By then, Amstutz will likely spend much of his 169.2 million Swiss francs ($174.29 million) in reserves as Molecular Partners pursues drugs for eye diseases with partner Allergan AGN.N as well as cancer with its earlier-stage oncology portfolio. After adding billionaire Hansjoerg Wyss as a 10 percent investor in April when Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N and others shed stakes, Amstutz is counting on trial results over the next 18 months to pique the interest of additional backers, be they shareholders or companies hunting drug candidates. “We can choose to sell either assets or shares,” Amstutz, a co-founder, told Reuters in an interview. “The good thing is we have a number of read-outs until 2019.”Headquartered near Zurich, Molecular Partners’ focus on eye diseases and oncology puts it into crowded markets dominated by drug giants.Abicipar, its drug with Allergan in Phase III trials against age-related blindness, aims to challenge Lucentis from Roche ROG.S and Novartis NOVN.S, and Bayer-Regeneron's Eylea. Those drugs have $8 billion in combined sales.Moreover, Novartis is developing another potential blockbuster, RTH258, for the same disease area.Amstutz is counting on Abicipar winning over doctors and patients with fewer injections -- like Lucentis and Eylea, it is administered via a shot directly into the eye -- and a dosing schedule that trims physician visits.There have been setbacks: Inflammation in a tenth of patients caused an 18-month delay for Allergan in 2013.“Since then, they have improved the formulation significantly,” Amstutz said, adding one-year Phase III trial efficacy data is due next year.To help advance its oncology portfolio, Molecular Partners added former Genentech drug developer Gwen Fyfe to its board this month.One of its top prospects, MP0250, for diseases like multiple myeloma, has entered Phase II trials on patients whose disease is resistant to Takeda's 4502.T Velcade. If Amstutz succeeds in expanding MP0250’s trials to additional tumour types, as he intends, that would likely break Molecular Partners’ go-it-alone R&D budget. A partnership would be virtually unavoidable.To that end, Johnson & Johnson's JNJ.N $30 billion takeover of Actelion ATLN.S boosts his optimism that Switzerland is on the radar screen of big companies and investors in hot pursuit of assets beyond the biotech hubs Boston and San Francisco.“There are two ways to get new money: Either it is asset dilutive or share dilutive,” said Amstutz. “We’ll definitely balance that very carefully with the aim to remain in a strong cash position.”"

2017-5-25,Drug approvals bounce back as R&D labs churn out new winners,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN18L1JZ,"LONDON (Reuters) - The number of new drugs approved for sale in United States and Europe has bounced back this year, suggesting a marked slowdown in 2016 was an aberration rather than a sign of flagging research and development productivity.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has already cleared 21 new prescription medicines for sale against 22 in the whole of 2016, and just nine at this stage last year.The European Medicines Agency has recommended 42 compared with a 2016 total of 81, and 31 in the first five months of last year. Unlike the FDA, the EMA includes generic or non-patented drugs in its list.John LaMattina, a former research head for Pfizer and a board member at PureTech Health, is unsurprised by the rebound and believes concerns raised at the end of 2016 about deteriorating drug pipelines were “far too dire”.Significantly, drugmakers are getting smarter about the way they develop medicines by shifting resources from mass-market products to more specialist and higher-priced therapies.That is fuelling a long-term pick-up in numbers, although it also stores up problems in terms of drug pricing as healthcare providers try to control their spending, with some new cancer treatments costing more than $10,000 a month.“A lot of biopharmaceutical companies are filling their pipelines with programs that seek treatments for diseases that can be approved with an accelerated review such as rare diseases, different cancers and anti-infectives,” LaMattina said.“These types of programs benefit from requiring modest-sized clinical trials and have the potential for generous pricing. We’re seeing fewer R&D resources devoted to programs that require rigorous differentiation in Phase III trials.”Phase III is the final stage when new drugs are tested on large numbers of patients.Big pharma companies are not necessarily out of the woods when it comes to getting a decent return on the billions of dollars they spend each year on R&D, since more and more drugs come from the labs of young biotech companies.But this year’s crop does include several highly promising products from large multinationals that are tipped to generate billions of dollars in sales, according to consensus analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.They include Sanofi and Regeneron’s Dupixent for severe eczema, projected to sell more than $5 billion by 2023, Roche’s multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus, with sales above $4 billion, and AstraZeneca’s cancer drug durvalumab, forecast to generate nearly $3 billion.Other major new medicines still awaiting approval this year include Novo Nordisk’s diabetes drug semaglutide, as well as a novel cell therapy for leukemia from Novartis and a shingles vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline.There have been setbacks as well, with Amgen and UCB, for example, no longer expecting their experimental osteoporosis drug to win approval in 2017 due to safety issues.After a spike in 2014 and 2015, there had been worries that last year’s fall in drug approvals to a six-year low might signal more fundamental problems in industry productivity or a slowdown by regulators.In fact, one-off factors contributed to the poor figure. Several drugs won an early green light at the end of 2015 and others had decisions pushed back into 2017, including Roche’s Ocrevus and Sanofi/Regeneron’s Kevzara for rheumatoid arthritis, which finally won a green light on Monday.According to QuintilesIMS, which compiles data for the pharmaceutical sector, the robust state of the industry’s late-phase R&D pipeline means it is well placed to yield an average of 40 to 45 new launches annually through to 2021.Hilary Thomas, chief medical adviser at KPMG, said U.S. regulators in particular were showing an innovative approach that was helping to accelerate approvals - as highlighted by a novel decision to clear a cancer drug for the first time based on genetics, not tumor location.Still, the targeted nature of many new medicines will limit the overall patient population getting the latest wave of novel drugs.“What the data masks is that while there might be more approvals, the total number of people getting new drugs is probably not going to up hugely because these are more specific, personalized treatments,” she said.F9or a graphic on FDA drug approvals, click"

2017-6-06,"Regeneron, Sanofi urge court to reverse ban on cholesterol drug",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1J31QV,"June 6 (Reuters) - A federal appeals court hinted on Tuesday it may let Sanofi AG and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc sell a cholesterol drug Amgen Inc has been trying to block on patent infringement grounds, according to lawyers and analysts who attended oral arguments in the case.Paul Clement, a lawyer for Regeneron and Sanofi, urged the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit to reverse a lower court order that would ban sales of their jointly developed drug Praluent for 12 years because it infringed patents owned by Amgen Inc, which makes a competing drug, Repatha.Clement asked the court to invalidate Amgen’s patents because they improperly claim a broad monopoly on an entire category of antibodies, known as PCSK9 inhibitors, that lower “bad” cholesterol levels.Amgen’s lawyer, Daryl Joseffer, argued the injunction was the only fair outcome in the dispute after a jury upheld the validity of Amgen’s patents. He also said Amgen’s patents reflect true innovations that resulted from a $2 billion investment in research and development.Zachary Silbersher, a patent lawyer at Kroub, Silbersher & Kolmykov who is not involved in the case, said the three judges’ questions frequently put Jossefer on the defensive and suggest that they may be “leaning a little toward Regeneron.”Silbersher noted that much of the argument focused on whether the trial judge unfairly handicapped Regeneron and Sanofi by blocking them from presenting certain evidence during the jury trial. That line of questioning suggests the Federal Circuit could order a do-over trial in the case, he said.Umer Raffat, an analyst at the investment banking advisory firm Evercore ISI, agreed the case is “leaning more toward Regeneron” but added that it was “impossible to call with high conviction.”PCSK9 inhibitors like Repatha and Praluent have been shown to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol and are expected to generate billions in sales. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved both drugs in 2015.Amgen sued Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron in 2014. A federal jury in Delaware upheld the validity of Amgen’s patents in March 2016, prompting U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson to hand down an injunction blocking Praluent sales for 12 years.The sales ban was stayed pending Regeneron and Sanofi’s appeal.

2017-6-14,Sanofi to invest further in biologics,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1951IV,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi announced plans to invest 600 million euros ($673 million) annually over the next two to three years in the field of biologics production, an area of strong growth potential.In contrast to most drugs that are chemically synthesized, many biologics are produced using living cells. They are seen as a promising answer in cardiovascular, neurology and cancer diseases.Experts say they also provide means to treat a variety of medical illnesses and conditions that have no other treatments available. But they are also more expensive than traditional products.In March, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi’s biologic drug for eczema, Dupixent, that will sell for a list price of $37,000 a year.Philippe Luscan, executive vice president of global industrial affairs at the French drugmaker, told reporters on Wednesday the investments would follow 3.3 billion euros already spent in this area in the last five years - representing the lion’s share of total investment in production of 4.7 billion euros.Earlier this year, Sanofi and Swiss manufacturer Lonza said they would spend 270 million euros by 2020 on a new large-scale biologics facility that will produce monoclonal antibodies.“In 2012, 43 percent of our pipeline was made of biologics. The figure stood at around 60 percent in 2016 and in 2020, it will increase even more,” Luscan said.Figures compiled by EvaluatePharma show conventional drugs still represented 70 percent of the top 100 medications sold worldwide before 2010, but that the proportion would narrow to 50 percent as soon as around 2022.Such projections do not automatically translate into higher volume sales for drugmakers because of a high potential for production problems and patent disputes in a competitive segment of the industry.In addition, the U.S. Supreme Court cut the time it will take for copycat versions of biologic drugs to get to the market in a pivotal ruling on Monday.The ruling has major implications for the pharmaceutical sector because it will dictate how long brand-name makers of biologic drugs can keep near-copies, called biosimilars, off the market.Sanofi had no immediate comment on the ruling."

Other major health stocks, including Regeneron and Amgen, were down between 1 percent and 3 percent.At 9:48 a.m. ET (1348 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 46.92 points, or 0.22 percent, at 21,350.37, the S&P 500 was down 2.2 points, or 0.09 percent, at 2,432.3.The Nasdaq Composite index was down 15.74 points, or 0.25 percent, at 6,220.94.Investors also awaited economic data and speeches by Federal Reserve policymakers for clues on interest rate hikes amid concerns over oil prices.Crude oil prices bounced off this week’s 10-month lows, but were still set for their worst first-half performance in almost two decades.Sliding oil prices have added to concerns on the inflation outlook, which along with a flattening yield curve, could pose a challenge to the Fed in deciding whether the economy was ready for another interest rate hike this year.“There is a concern that economy maybe struggling slightly, with oil prices hitting lows,” said Andre Bakhos, managing director at Janlyn Capital in Bernardsville, New Jersey.“If it’s a supply problem, it’s wonderful for the market,” he said. “If it is demand that is starting to wane, then it’s going to create more questions than give us answers.”At current levels, the S&P 500 energy index, down 15 percent so far this year, is on track to post its worst weekly decline in about 18 months.Four of the 11 major S&P sectors were lower, with the S&P 500 consumer discretionary sector’s 0.37 percent fall leading the decliners.Shares of Bank of America, JPMorgan, Wells Fargo and Goldman Sachs were up marginally following the Fed’s stress test results on Thursday. The results showed that 34 largest U.S. banks have all cleared the first stage, implying they would be able to maintain enough capital in an extreme recession.St. Louis Fed President James Bullard, Cleveland Fed chief Loretta Mester and Fed governor Jerome Powell are all scheduled to make appearances later in the day.Economic data due includes new U.S. single family home sales for May at 10:00 a.m. ET. The reading is expected to show that single family home sales likely grew 5.4 percent.Caterpillar was off 0.74 percent, following a Deutsche Bank downgrade to “hold”.U.S.-listed shares of Blackberry were down 10.6 percent at $9.88 after the company’s quarterly revenue missed analysts’ estimate.Bed Bath & Beyond was down 10.4 percent after the home furnishing retailer reported a bigger-than-expected fall in same-store sales in the first quarter.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,307 to 1,195.

Even so, another set of data showed the University of Michigan consumer sentiment index at its lowest since November.“In the next four to six weeks we’ll get another set of economic data that will tell us if the Fed is justified in raising rates again this year,” said Sandven.Towards the end of the second quarter, the market witnessed a few volatile days with the S&P 500 and the Dow recording their worst daily percentage drop in about six weeks on Thursday.Oil prices climbed for the seventh straight session on Friday in their longest bull run since April, but were still set for the worst first-half performance since 1998.Micron reversed gains to fall 4.1 percent even after the chipmaker forecast better-than-expected profit and revenue for fourth quarterAdvancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,690 to 1,145.

But Morgan Stanley analysts said in a note that sales had fallen short of a buyside consensus closer to $40-50 million.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the injectable biotech medicine for atopic dermatitis - also known as eczema - in March.The launch of Dupixent is key for both Sanofi and Regeneron, which are also developing the product for severe asthma.Bernstein said the Dupixent revenue figure came in between its forecast of 25 million euros and a consensus of 33 million.Sanofi said 13,000 patients had been prescribed the medication, which also received a positive recommendation from a European Medicines Agency panel earlier this month.According to Thomson Reuters data, analysts expect Dupixent to reach annual sales of 4.7 billion euros by 2023 and Sanofi sees the product spearheading its drive into greater reliance on high-margin biotech, or biologic, drugs.Sanofi’s second-quarter net income was down 0.5 percent at constant exchange rates to 1.7 billion euros - in line with analysts’ forecasts. Total sales rose 5.5 percent to 8.66 billion euros.Analysts polled by Reuters in partnership with Inquiry Financial had on average been expecting business net profit of 1.7 billion euros and net sales of 8.7 billion.The geographical mix of sales showed strong momentum in emerging markets and Europe but falling revenues in the U.S.While nearly all of Sanofi’s units recorded double-digit revenue growth in the quarter, sales at the group’s diabetes division were down 15 percent due to persistent pricing pressure in the United States, where prescriptions of cheaper copies of the group’s treatments are increasing."

The FDA is not obliged to follow the advice of its advisers but typically does so.The most common causes of death were major heart problems, infection and malignancies.Other potential safety issues related to immune system suppression were similar to other products in the class, but the trend of increased overall mortality “seems unique for the sirukumab program,” the report said. It was published on the FDA’s website.Brian Kenney, a J&J spokesman, said rheumatoid arthritis is a complex and serious disease, with patients frequently cycling through multiple therapies until finding one that may work for them. “We are confident in the benefit-to-risk of sirukumab,” he said.J&J was originally developing the drug, which would be known as Plivensia if approved, with GlaxoSmithKline Plc. GSK recently said it would end the program and return all rights to J&J. GSK had rights to the drug in North, Central and South America.Sirukumab is a human monoclonal antibody that blocks a cytokine in the body known as interleukin 6 (IL-6), which can contribute to the inflammation associated with rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune disorder that affects more than 1.3 million Americans.Sirukumab is designed to patients who have failed or cannot tolerate one or more disease modifying drug such as methotrexate.Sirukumab would compete with Roche Holding AG’s IL-6 inhibitor Actemra and a recently approved IL-6 therapy, Kevzara, or sarilumab, made by Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.Analysts on average forecast global sales of Kevzara to reach about $667 million by 2020, according to Thomson Reuters data.

The iPhone maker’s shares were up 0.25 percent.Tech has been the best performing sector this year, despite recent bouts of volatility on rising valuation concerns. The tech index’s 0.49 percent rise on Tuesday led the major S&P sectors.Amazon provided the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq with its 1.5 percent rise.“While valuations overall and for the tech sector isn’t cheap, some of the most powerful earnings growth has come from large-cap technology names,” said Bill Northey, chief investment officer at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.Investors have been counting on earnings to support high valuations for equities. The S&P 500 is trading at about 18 times earnings estimates for the next 12 months, above its long-term average of 15 times.S&P 500 earnings are expected on average to have grown 10.8 percent in the second quarter, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.“We are two-thirds through the earnings season and estimates are going only higher, including for the full year, which is helping support the fundamentals-driven market.” said Northey.At 10:58 a.m. ET (1458 GMT), the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 89.92 points, or 0.41 percent, at 21,981.04 and the S&P 500 was up 5.6 points, or 0.22 percent, at 2,475.90.The Nasdaq Composite was up 16.49 points, or 0.26 percent, at 6,364.61.A 0.22 percent fall in healthcare led the laggards. Pfizer was down 1.10 percent after the drugmaker’s quarterly revenue missed expectations.Regeneron fell 3.58 percent following a rating downgrade by a brokerage. The stock was the top drag on the Nasdaq.Economic data showed U.S. consumer spending barely rose in June as income failed to increase for the first time in seven months.The core PCE numbers - the Federal Reserve’s preferred metric to gauge inflation - for June edged up 0.1 percent following a similar increase in May.In the 12 months through June, the so-called core PCE price index increased 1.5 percent after advancing by the same margin in May, remaining below the Fed’s 2 percent target rate.Under Armour fell 6.41 percent after the sportswear maker cut its full-year sales forecast.Sprint jumped 9.78 percent after swinging to a quarterly profit for the first time in three years.Advancing issues outnumbered decliners on the NYSE by 1,599 to 1,113.

2017-8-03,"Regeneron beats profit view, to end antibody deal with Sanofi",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N1KP4BO,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc reported a much better-than-expected quarterly profit on strong demand for its flagship Eylea drug and said it would end one of its agreements with France’s Sanofi SA to develop antibodies by the end of the year.Shares of Regeneron, which also raised its full-year growth forecast for the eye treatment, closed down 2 percent at $467.11 on Thursday.“Surprisingly, Regeneron announced its decade-long antibody discovery deal with Sanofi will end ...,” CFRA Research’s Jeffrey Loo said, adding that the deal provided the U.S. drugmaker with over $1 billion in R&D funding.Sales of Eylea, which is used to treat macular degeneration and other eye disorders that cause age-related vision loss, came in at $919 million in the second quarter and beat analysts’ estimates, helped by higher demand.Eylea had maintained a market-leading position in all approved indications in the United States despite competition from drugs such as Lucentis from Roche Holding AG and Novartis AG, Regeneron said.Regeneron now expects U.S. Eylea sales to grow 10 percent over 2016. It had previously estimated single-digit percentage growth over the $3.32 billion generated in U.S. sales last year.The U.S. biotech is betting on two recently approved, potential blockbusters - its eczema treatment Dupixent and rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara - to reduce its heavy reliance on Eylea.Partner Sanofi revealed earlier this week that Dupixent generated sales of 26 million euros ($30.88 million) in the drug’s first full quarter on the market. This came in well short of analysts’ expectations.Regeneron on Thursday said it was encouraged by initial Dupixent adoption, and expected to secure broad U.S. market access and European approval by the end of 2017.Key data from a trial testing Dupixent as a treatment for asthma is also expected later this year.Kevzara, which was launched in the United States in late May, generated $1 million in sales.Sanofi said the expiration of the antibody discovery agreement would not impact the agreement covering Praluent, Dupixent and Kevzara.Regeneron is also banking on a plethora of experimental drugs in its pipeline to fuel long-term growth. In particular, it highlighted the potential of its cancer immunotherapy, REGN2810.Lower expenses and a significantly smaller tax rate also helped Regeneron smash analysts’ estimates for adjusted profit by a dollar, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Total revenue of $1.47 billion also beat estimates."

2017-9-07,Quest to offer cholesterol testing without fasting requirement,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1LN23Z,"(Reuters) - Quest Diagnostics Inc said on Thursday it will begin using a more precise method of calculating levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol that no longer requires fasting prior to blood draw, a development likely to delight patients who previously had to refrain from eating for up to 12 hours before testing.High LDL levels are a key marker of heart disease, with the testing used to determine whether patients should be taking statins, such as Lipitor, or other cholesterol-lowering medications to help prevent heart attacks and strokes. With the current formula for calculating LDL in use since 1972, failure to fast can lead to inaccurate results.Cholesterol testing is also used to determine if heart patients are achieving LDL target levels, such as under 70 for those deemed at high-risk or under 100 for those at more moderate risk.In a recent study published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, researches said the current calculation method “may lead to the misclassification of high-risk individuals and subsequent under-utilization of lipid-lowering therapies.”The new LDL calculation method may be especially helpful in following people eligible for potent new injectable PCSK9 cholesterol drugs sold by Amgen Inc or Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and partner Sanofi SA. The old formula was not designed to assess the unprecedented low LDL levels those medicines can now get patients down to.Being able to eat before testing is almost sure to increase patient compliance.“Fasting for eight to 12 hours before visiting a patient service center for a blood draw in the morning is challenging and may deter many patients from participating in lipid testing,” Quest Chief Medical Officer Jay Wohlgemuth said in a statement.Cost and insurance coverage are unaffected by the change, Quest said.Quest will use the new calculation method at its 2,200 patient service centers under a license agreement with Johns Hopkins University. The formula was developed by Hopkins cardiologist Dr. Seth Martin.“It’s amazing that since 1972 this had never been updated or changed,” Martin said in an interview, calling it “extremely gratifying” to see his method widely implemented.The new calculation method was determined using massive amounts of data and modern computing power that were not available to the National Institutes of Health when the cholesterol testing formula was developed 45 years ago, Martin said.Cholesterol testing is among the top 10 most commonly ordered test services Quest provides each year, the company said."

But analysts said the data appeared less impressive than the drug’s mid-stage data.At 52 weeks, dupilumab reduced severe asthma attacks by 46 percent in the overall population in the late-stage trial. This is significantly lower than about 71 percent reduction shown in mid-stage data, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.GlaxoSmithKline’s is currently leading the field in the treatment of asthma using injectable antibody drugs but rivals are closing in, with Sanofi and AstraZeneca both seen as strong contenders.Last week, AstraZeneca and Amgen reported positive mid-stage data for their asthma drug.Efficacy of Regeneron’s drug in patients with high eosinophils looks competitive, though it appears less effective than AstraZeneca Plc and Amgen Inc’s tezepelumab, Cowen & Co said in a note.The asthma opportunity could be more limited than prior expectations, SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Yatin Suneja said, adding that he expects the drug to be used mainly for patients with higher levels of eosinophils.Sanofi and Regeneron plan to submit an application to use the medicine in severe asthma to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration by the end of this year.Elias Zerhouni, managing director and president of global research and development at Sanofi, said the results underscored the benefits of focusing on specific molecular pathways behind diseases.“The positive data from this large second pivotal trial in uncontrolled persistent asthma, following the positive results of dupilumab in atopic dermatitis, further support this view in our opinion,” he said.Shares of Regeneron were down 4.5 percent to $450.09, while Sanofi’s U.S.-listed shares were down about 1 percent at $48.92."

The product is sold as Dupixent.Atopic dermatitis is a chronic type of skin inflammation also known as eczema, which in severe cases causes constant, and often unbearable, itching.A human monoclonal antibody, Dupixent is designed to specifically inhibit two key proteins which are believed to be major drivers of the disease.Sanofi plans to submit an application to the FDA for a use of dupilumab in asthma by the end of the year and hinted recently at a possible use of the drug in nasal polyps.Analysts on average expect Dupixent to reach annual sales of 4.7 billion euros ($5.53 billion) by 2023, according to Thomson Reuters data.Shares of Regeneron and Sanofi slid earlier this month after late-stage trial data for dupilumab in asthma fell short of investor expectations. Analysts said the data appeared less impressive than the drug’s mid-stage data.Investors had also expressed disappointment with the sales take-up of Dupixent when Sanofi published its second quarter-results in July, although but Sanofi expressed confidence that the drug would sell well."

BARDA will also buy Ebola treatments from Mapp Biopharmaceutical Inc and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.The products were rushed through testing in response to the West African Ebola outbreak in 2014-2016 that infected 28,600 people and killed more than 11,000. Ebola causes severe fever, vomiting, diarrhea and bleeding.“Today we are prepared to add four Ebola countermeasures to the stockpile, whereas three years ago, very few products were even in early stages of development,” BARDA Director Rick Bright said.He attributed the “unprecedented speed” of products’ development to partnerships across the U.S. government, other nations and private industry.The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases provided early-stage funding for many of the products. The new funding is through Project BioShield, which supports late-stage development toward licensure and stockpile purchases.Under the agreements, BARDA will provide funding for each company to validate its manufacturing processes and make final preparations needed to apply for FDA approval.

It lists an Eylea biosimilar at the preclinical stage on its pipeline chart, putting it behind the Momenta/Mylan candidate.Eylea, which treats a leading cause of blindness in the elderly - wet age-related macular degeneration - and related eye conditions, accounts for most of Regeneron’s revenue.Regeneron shares fell 1.5 percent to $388 in extended trading. Momenta shares rose 6 percent to $15, while Mylan shares were unchanged from their Nasdaq close at $43.14.U.S. Eylea sales rose 12 percent in the third quarter to $953 million. Sales outside the United States, which are booked by Bayer AG, rose 20 percent in the most recently reported quarter. Global sales in 2016 exceeded $5 billion.Eylea is also approved to treat macular edema following retinal vein occlusion, diabetic macular edema and diabetic retinopathy in patients with diabetic macular edema.The proposed trial of the biosimilar, currently called M710, will be in patients with diabetic macular edema and compare the safety, efficacy and immunogenicity with Eylea.Unlike generic versions of traditional pills, it is not possible to produce exact copies of complex biotech medicines made from living cells, thus the term biosimilar. Proposed biosimilars must prove themselves to be close enough to the original drug to satisfy regulators."

2018-1-08,Regeneron forms consortium to accelerate gene sequencing project,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1P01EX,"Jan 8 (Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Monday announced a collaboration with rival drugmakers that will speed its effort to collect genetic information on 500,000 people in the UK Biobank database, a project it believes could help accelerate new drug discovery and improve approval success rates.The data will be made available to health researchers anywhere in the world following a 6-to-12-month period of exclusive access by consortium members, Regeneron said.“This is the first case where there will be large-scale human sequencing linked to large-scale human medical records that will also be publicly available,” Regeneron President and Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said in a telephone interview.Pfizer Inc, AbbVie Inc, AstraZeneca Plc and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc each agreed to put $10 million toward the effort, funding that will make it possible to complete exome sequencing of 500,000 participants by the end of 2019, rather than Regeneron’s original timeline of 2022.The exome is the small percentage of the human genome containing all coding genes for proteins, which are used as targets for many medicines.“This is great example of the lifesciences industry stepping up and giving back something that is going to help society while also accelerating our own efforts to come up with new drug targets and new medicines,” Yancopoulos said.“Historically, (industry) failure rates have been too high and that’s one of the reasons healthcare costs are so high,” he said. “Genetically validated targets have a much higher success rate.”The data linking human genetic variations to human biology and disease could also help the U.S. National Institutes of Health and academic researchers make their own discoveries, Yancopoulos said.In addition to new funding, rapidly improving technology will hasten the project. “We have been more than doubling our sequencing capacity every year,” he said.The UK Biobank is an exceptional partner for the effort, he said, because of the enormous amount of medical data it has compiled, including whole-body imaging and periodic MRI scans of the brain, chest and abdomen in addition to primary care information.Yancopoulos acknowledged likely limits to genetic variations and diversity with all subjects coming from the UK and hopes this will spur similar large-scale efforts with other populations.“We are looking for other big projects to do. We think this a great model.”"

2018-10-17,"Express Scripts covers Amgen, Lilly migraine drugs, excludes Teva",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1MR1IA,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co, one of the largest U.S. prescription benefits managers, will cover new migraine drugs from Eli Lilly and Amgen Inc, but exclude a rival medication from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd after price negotiations with all three manufacturers.The decision represents a setback for Israel-based Teva , which is in the midst of a corporate restructuring and had hoped to capture a sizable share of the multibillion-dollar migraine market. Express Scripts is also taking steps to limit use of the Amgen and Lilly migraine drugs to patients it says are most likely to benefit from them.Pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) are taking more aggressive action to lower the cost of prescription drugs for their clients, large employers who pay for health benefits for their workers.Teva’s Nasdaq-listed shares fell 4 percent to $21.32, while Amgen was up slightly at $203.03 and Lilly shares rose 2 percent to $113.23.The new migraine treatments were approved for the U.S. market within a few months of each other this year. That gave Express Scripts more leverage in demanding a discount in exchange for putting a therapy on its “formulary,” or list of covered drugs. “These products are fairly interchangeable,” Harold Carter, clinical solutions director at Express Scripts, told Reuters. “It comes down to manufacturers providing the best value to be on the formulary.” He acknowledged that price rebates played a role in determining coverage status, but declined to comment on the level of rebating.In May, Amgen and marketing partner Novartis AG won U.S. approval for Aimovig, an injected drug designed to interfere with a process that helps kick off migraine headaches. Teva’s Ajovy and Lilly’s Emgality were approved last month.The three drugs work in a similar manner and represent an improvement over older treatments. In clinical trials they significantly reduced migraine frequency in about half of patients.Wei-Li Shao, vice president of neuroscience at Eli Lilly, told Reuters last month that discounts and rebates for Emgality would be negotiated with insurers and other payers.Teva, in an emailed statement, said it was “disappointed” with Express Scripts’ decision, but has programs in place to make sure patients can access Ajovy, which is seeing “strong demand” in the few weeks since its launch.All three drugs have a list price of $575 a month, or $6,900 a year. Geoffrey Porges, biotech analyst at Leerink, told Reuters he expects the drugmakers will need to offer rebates of at least 30 percent for the new migraine class to be covered by insurance.Express Scripts already lists Amgen’s Aimovig as a preferred treatment on its largest formulary, but requires patients first try two older preventive therapies and a triptan, a family of generic drugs that treat acute migraine. Lilly’s Emgality will be covered under the same terms. Amgen, Lilly and Express Scripts will also begin next April to refund part of the drug cost if a migraine patient stops treatment within 90 days, indicating that the medication does not work for them or causes too many side effects. That refund, between 25 percent and 30 percent of the drugs’ list price, would be returned to Express Scripts clients, and comes in addition to the rebates it has already negotiated.39 MILLION MIGRAINE SUFFERERS “Everyone in the chain is taking some accountability for the cost of the drug,” Carter said, adding that the refund means the manufacturers are sharing financial risk if the drugs do not work as well as claimed. Around 39 million Americans suffer from migraine headaches, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Worldwide migraine drug sales could reach $8.7 billion by 2026, according to analytics firm GlobalData. But Carter estimated that only about 128,000 of the 83 million people who get their prescription drug benefits through Express Scripts will be good candidates for the migraine-prevention drugs. Under the Migraine Care Value program that will launch next April, Express Scripts will have its specially trained pharmacists, nurses and other staff assess appropriate care and access to therapies for patients. The PBM, which is being acquired by Cigna Corp, created a similar program in 2015 that sharply limited the use of two novel, and expensive, cholesterol drugs - from Amgen and partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi SA.For the new migraine drugs “the challenges will likely be right out of the gate, seeing if patients are responding to the therapy,” Carter said. The drugmakers have already tried to pre-empt efforts to limit access to the new treatments. Amgen and Lilly are offering initial free samples directly to patients and their doctors. For patients covered by commercial insurance who are still having trouble getting reimbursed, the companies have programs to supply the drugs at no cost for up to another 12 months. All three companies also have programs that cover much of an individual’s out of pocket costs under a commercial insurance plan. Some large health insurers, such as Anthem Inc, have similar coverage terms for Aimovig, requiring patients to document the number of headaches they suffer each month, and show that they have tried older migraine treatments first. Others, including Blue Cross/Blue Shield plans in states like Pennsylvania and Kansas, only cover prescriptions for the new drugs from - or in consultation with - a neurologist or headache specialist, and not a primary care doctor.Some plans have not yet determined coverage terms, meaning each prescription has to go through a lengthy review process."

2018-10-24,Amgen cuts price of cholesterol drug Repatha by 60 percent,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1X41K6,"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc, looking to boost use of its potent cholesterol drug Repatha, has cut the medication’s U.S. list price by 60 percent to $5,850, the U.S. biotechnology company said on Wednesday.Repatha and rival drug Praluent from partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA were launched in 2015 at list prices of more than $14,000 a year.Sales of both - members of a class known as PCSK9 inhibitors that dramatically lower bad LDL cholesterol - have been constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access by insurers looking to limit spending on the expensive drugs.Amgen’s move “is clearly focused on helping patients afford the medicine at the pharmacy counter,” said Murdo Gordon, the company’s head of commercial operations.He said the drug, which has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks in high-risk patients, needs to be affordable to patients on Medicare, the federal government’s health plan for seniors.Amgen and other drugmakers have assistance programs to cover co-pays and deductibles for patients covered by commercial insurance, but are barred by law from paying those costs for people on government-funded health plans.The new $5,850 price is in line with the current net price Amgen gets after discounts and rebates to pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) and health insurers, said Amgen spokeswoman Kristen Davis.In May, Regeneron and Sanofi agreed with pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts Holding Co to lower Praluent’s price to between $4,500 and $8,000 in exchange for easier access for patients covered by the PBM’s largest plan.Express Scripts still lists Regeneron’s drug as the preferred PCSK9 option under that plan, but said on Wednesday it may “re-evaluate based on Amgen’s update.”“Amgen is taking an important step forward to help payers be better positioned to provide breakthrough medicines and help people achieve better outcomes,” Express Scripts’ Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in a statement.Amgen estimates that 75 percent of Repatha prescriptions for Medicare patients are not filled due to high out-of-pocket costs.Gordon said Amgen expects that with the new lower list price for Repatha, Medicare Part D plans will list the drug with a fixed co-pay, rather than require patients to cover a percentage of the drug’s price as most now do.He said nearly half of the 3.4 million Americans estimated to be eligible for treatment with Repatha are on Medicare. Currently, the drug is being used by around 50,000 patients worldwide, Amgen said.“In the long term it is our hope that we can address more patient needs, leading ultimately to higher revenue,” Gordon said.Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, worldwide sales of Repatha totaled just $271 million in the first half of 2018. Sales of Praluent were $134 million in the same period.Amgen said the new list price will take affect immediately for most Repatha sales, and said the drug sold under the original list price will be phased out by the end of 2020 in order to limit any disruption to existing contracts.The company said it has been offering healthcare payers significant rebates this year in exchange for improved patient access to Repatha.Gordon said Amgen may continue to offer rebates to some PBMs and insurers. “If plans are interested in moving to affordable, fixed co-pay tiers, we are not going to be slow to respond to them,” he said."

Currently, the drug is being used by around 50,000 patients worldwide, Amgen said.“In the long term it is our hope that we can address more patient needs, leading ultimately to higher revenue,” Gordon said.Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, worldwide sales of Repatha totaled just $271 million in the first half of 2018. Sales of Praluent were $134 million in the same period.Amgen said the new list price will take affect immediately for most Repatha sales, and said the drug sold under the original list price will be phased out by the end of 2020 in order to limit any disruption to existing contracts.The company said it has been offering healthcare payers significant rebates this year in exchange for improved patient access to Repatha.Gordon said Amgen may continue to offer rebates to some PBMs and insurers. “If plans are interested in moving to affordable, fixed co-pay tiers, we are not going to be slow to respond to them,” he said.Shares of Amgen, which fell 5 percent in regular trading, were little changed at $187.95 after hours."
2018-10-25,Trump seeks to base Medicare drug prices on lower overseas rates,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1MZ2SF,"WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, taking aim at “global freeloading,” said on Thursday his administration would seek to lower prescription drug prices by basing what the government’s Medicare program pays for some medications on the lower prices paid in other countries.Under the proposed rule, the government would create an “international pricing index” to help Medicare pay prescription drug prices that are more closely aligned with those of other countries. The government health insurance program for the elderly and disabled covers more than 40 million Americans.“We’re taking aim at the global freeloading that forces American consumers to subsidize lower prices in foreign countries through higher prices in our country,” Trump said in a speech at the Department of Health and Human Services.“The world reaps the benefit of American genius,” said Trump, who has pledged to lower prescription drug prices.Healthcare and high prescription drug prices have consistently polled as top voter concerns ahead of Nov. 6 elections where Trump’s Republicans are battling to maintain control of Congress.The administration said it did not plan to propose the rule until next spring, and would begin implementing it in 2020 over a five-year period.Enacting the rule does not require congressional approval, but it was met with swift opposition from drugmakers and would likely be challenged by many stakeholders in the healthcare industry.By law, the Medicare program cannot negotiate drug prices. Under the Trump administration proposal, private-sector vendors would negotiate down drug prices and supply the medicines to doctors and hospitals.HHS said the proposed rule would cover most of the drugs in Medicare’s Part B, which includes expensive physician- administered drugs such as infusions.According to HHS projections, the rule, if it took full effect, would save $17.2 billion over five years, which would benefit the federal government and Medicare beneficiaries.Trump has criticized foreign governments with single-payer healthcare systems, such as the UK and France, that are able to negotiate prices directly with drug companies and often pay far less for the same medications than the United States.The United States does not directly negotiate drug prices with manufacturers and American consumers often pay the highest prices for drugs. The Trump administration has said U.S. drug prices and manufacturer revenues are subsidizing lower prices in other countries.In a briefing with reporters on Thursday, HHS Secretary Alex Azar said the administration planned to first test the rule in 50 percent of the country, applying it to drugs in Part B that have a single manufacturer.The proposed rule would also eliminate an add-on payment that physicians receive from Medicare that the administration and critics say encourages the prescribing of higher-priced drugs.‘FOREIGN PRICE CONTROLS’Previous similar attempts at such rules in Medicare have come up against fierce industry opposition and failed to take effect.Shortly after Trump’s speech, pharmaceutical industry lobby group PhRMA said it opposed the changes, which it said would limit access to drugs for cancer and chronic conditions like rheumatoid arthritis.“The administration is imposing foreign price controls from countries with socialized health care systems that deny their citizens access and discourage innovation,” PhRMA Chief Executive Stephen Ubl said in a statement.Democrats questioned the timing of the administration’s proposal and expressed skepticism it would come to fruition.“It’s hard to take the Trump administration and Republicans seriously about reducing health care costs for seniors two weeks before the election,” Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement.The United States spent nearly $26 billion for Medicare Part B drugs in 2016, the most recent year for which data is available.The top drugs that year were Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s chemotherapy drug Eylea, Roche Holding AG’s cancer and rheumatoid arthritis treatment Rituxan and Amgen Inc’s Neulasta, which helps reduce the risk of infection during cancer treatment. Medicare spending on the three drugs alone totaled more than $4 billion.Representatives from the three companies did not immediately respond to requests for comment on the plan.Shares of U.S. drugmakers opened trading down early on Thursday, as Politico had reported details of the plan overnight. But shares recovered later in the day, and the ARCA pharmaceutical index was up about 1.8 percent on Thursday afternoon."

It plans to resubmit its application early next year.Regeneron told Reuters the regulator has also asked for the completion of a small study, involving about 30 patients, to demonstrate doctors are able to administer the product.Eylea has made Regeneron a dominant player in the eye-disease space and brought in sales of $3.70 billion in the United States last year.But with Swiss drugmaker Roche AG’s prefilled syringe rival treatment threatening market share, Regeneron has thrown marketing heft behind Eylea and pushed for its approval in additional indications.Regeneron also said Eylea met the main goal in a late-stage trial testing it in patients with moderately severe and severe diabetic retinopathy, an eye disease that is the leading cause of vision impairment and blindness among working-age adults.Data from the one-year trial showed that without treatment, over a third of patients developed a vision-threatening complication or diabetic macular edema (DME).“Eylea was able to reduce these complications by 68 percent to 85 percent even with every four-month dosing, and moreover was able to reverse the anatomic severity of the disease,” Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said.Eylea is currently approved to treat the about 1.5 million adults living with DME in the United States.The new data will contribute to the company’s application that seeks to expand use of the drug to people with diabetic retinopathy at risk of developing DME, expected to receive an FDA decision by May."

2018-10-29,Drugmakers tout new medicines as eye disease battle intensifies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1X90UF,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland’s Roche and Novartis and other drugmakers are touting new treatments for a blindness-causing disease that hits millions of older people, as patent expiries are set to open up one of medicine’s most lucrative markets.Roche’s experimental treatment faricimab showed long-lasting effectiveness against age-related macular degeneration (AMD), the Basel-based drugmaker said on Monday, potentially reducing the frequency of uncomfortable, direct-in-the-eye shots.Molecular Partners, together with partner Allergan, and Novartis, also released data on new AMD medicines at an industry conference in Chicago.For years, Lucentis, from Roche and Novartis, and Bayer and Regeneron’s Eylea, have dominated AMD treatment, with combined 2017 sales topping $9 billion.With patent expiries starting in 2020, however, the scramble is on to preserve - or capture - a chunk of one of medicine’s hardest-fought areas, analysts said.The AMD landscape is getting more crowded and less differentiated, with new medicines offering only marginal therapeutic improvements while remaining costly, said Baader Helvea analyst Bruno Bulic.The question, Bulic said, is: “How long the cash cow can still be milked before the end?”Potential pricing reforms under U.S. President Donald Trump could also disrupt the market.The U.S. government-administered Medicare health plan for seniors spent $3.25 billion in 2016 on Eylea and Lucentis alone. The Trump administration is seeking ways to lower the cost of drugs on Medicare.That could eventually help Samsung Bioepis of South Korea and Mylan, which are developing biosimilars of Lucentis and Eylea that are expected to be cheaper.[reut.rs/2qhPveW]The new drugs will also still face competition from Roche’s Avastin, a cancer medicine used for years to treat AMD in many markets despite not being officially approved to do so. Avastin costs just a fraction of Lucentis and Eylea.Last month, Novartis, Bayer and Roche lost a bid to stop British doctors from recommending Avastin, potentially clearing the way for Britain’s National Health Service to begin broader use of the cheaper drug.Because new AMD drugs in studies have proven to be as effective, but not necessarily better, in helping vision as Eylea and Lucentis, their backers are seeking to underscore other benefits, like the need for less frequent shots.Compared with monthly Lucentis injections, “data show the potential of faricimab to allow fewer injections while achieving and sustaining the same visual gains,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer.Novartis plans to submit its new drug, RTH258, to U.S. and European regulators in December, with approval due next year. It is promoting RTH258 data showing the drug is better than Eylea at controlling fluid in the retina, a hallmark of AMD.($1 = 0.7795 pounds)"
2018-10-31,Vaccines and Genzyme help Sanofi keep promise of return to growth,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1N50MS,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi lifted its 2018 profit target for the second time this year after robust sales of its vaccines and rare diseases division, Genzyme, helped it beat third-quarter profit expectations.The French drugmaker, hurt by declining sales of its diabetes treatments and a struggle to refill its drug pipeline fast enough in recent years, said it now expected earnings per share to grow by between 4 and 5 percent this year, up from a previous 3-5 percent target range.Several big pharmaceutical companies have raised their 2018 outlook this month on the back of better-than-anticipated quarterly results, including Johnson and Johnson, Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb in the United States.Investors were keen to see Sanofi deliver on its pledge to achieve growth in the third quarter following a flat first half.Shares in the drugmaker were up 5 percent in early trading.To compensate for slumping sales at its diabetes unit, Sanofi has been busy on multiple fronts this year, completing takeover deals worth about $16 billion, expanding in oncology and speeding up cost-cutting efforts.Revenue of Dupixent, widely seen as the company’s most exciting approved treatment - the drug is prescribed for eczema in adults and was approved in the United States this month as an additional therapy for two types of asthma - totaled 225 million euros in the third quarter, ahead of analysts’ estimates.Sanofi co-develops Dupixent with U.S partner Regeneron for at least seven other conditions including paediatric asthma, chronic sinus infection with nasal polyps, and adolescent eczema.Sanofi’s third-quarter net income rose by 10.3 percent at constant exchange rates to 2.3 billion euros ($2.6 billion) while revenues increased 6.3 percent to 9.4 billion euros.Analysts polled by Reuters in partnership with Inquiry Financial had on average expected a net income of 2.14 billion euros on revenues of 9.3 billion euros.Sales at Genzyme surged 36.1 percent to 1.9 billion euros. Vaccines’ revenue, hit in the second quarter by supply constraints of an infant vaccine in China, rose 8.2 percent.Diabetes and cardiovascular sales, however, fell 12.1 percent.On Tuesday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted priority review for Sanofi’s vaccine against dengue despite high concerns around its use for patients who have not previously been exposed to the disease.A spokesman for Sanofi said several private laboratories in Puerto Rico - where the vaccine would be deployed if approved in the United States - offered commercial dengue tests before a rapid test Sanofi is working on can be made available."

2018-11-09,U.S. regulators snip red tape for medical devices to curb opioid crisis,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1NE0GQ,"(Reuters) - Laura Perryman expected her medical company, Stimwave Technologies Inc, would have to wait several years for its painkilling device to win U.S. approval as a treatment for chronic migraines.She now thinks it could be done in months, thanks to a new initiative by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to use medical device-based treatments, diagnostic tests and mobile medical apps to address the country’s opioid crisis.When President Donald Trump declared a public health emergency over the abuse of heavy-duty painkillers like oxycodone and hydrocodone, he ordered all government agencies to take action in response to the death of 70,000 Americans last year from drug overdoses.The FDA told Reuters it has received over 200 submissions from companies seeking a speedy approval process for their devices. These range from Stimwave’s Halo to painkilling products made by Abbott Laboratories and other industry heavyweights as an alternative to opioids.“We’re pleased by the robust interest in this innovation challenge and the acknowledgement from developers about the unique and important role medical devices, including digital health technologies like mobile medical apps, have the potential to play in tackling the opioid crisis,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.Perryman’s Halo devices, which look like angel hair pasta and are so small they can be injected into a nerve, took four years to get U.S. approval under other names for easing leg and back pain.She hopes a spot on the FDA program will see Halo approved within a year as an alternative to opioids, which are currently used to treat an estimated 50 percent of patients who come to emergency rooms with migraines.“This is kind of perfect for something like ours...since the device is shown to be safe already,” said Perryman, who founded privately-held Stimwave in South Florida seven years ago.The FDA has been increasingly reluctant to greenlight new opioids for market but earlier this month approved a potent opioid-based painkiller from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc placing tight restrictions on its distribution and use. In a rare move, Gottlieb made a public statement at the time, explaining the decision.The regulator’s push for alternatives to opioids has helped drive interest from venture capital funds and institutional investors this year in firms promising to develop alternatives, according to interviews with device companies, financial services firms and brokerage Cowen & Co.For example, privately-held Virpax Pharmaceuticals, which makes an aerosol spray that delivers a non-opioid pain drug, said it had four or five banks interested in running its Series A investment round this summer versus just one in the past.Abbott, like rivals Boston Scientific Corp and Nevro Corp, makes neuromodulation implants which stimulate the nervous system to mask pain signals before they reach the brain.Abbott has submitted an entry for the competition in the hope it will slash waiting times, which often stretch several months just to get an initial meeting, according to Dr. Allen Burton, Abbott’s medical director of neuromodulation.“Devices that are part of this (program) will be streamlined... their meeting will go to the top of the pile,” said Burton.While neuromodulation is only a small part of Abbott’s large medical device business, the unit is seen as a growth engine for the company. Burton estimates between 10-to-20 percent of the growth Abbott has seen in its neuromodulation business could be tied to doctors prescribing its devices for pain after surgery or from injury to patients that are opioid averse.Boston Scientific did not apply for the contest, but the company is investing “heavily” in its neuromodulation unit, which was its fastest-growing at nearly 23 percent in the latest quarter, according to Maulik Nanavaty, senior vice president at the device maker.“We continue to make external investments in early (neuromodulation) technology,” he told Reuters.To be sure, these devices are not seen as a silver bullet for opioid addiction. Nirad Jain, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co, believes many of the solutions on the table are just tinkering at the edges of a problem that needs to be solved by doctors simply settling for fewer or less potent opioids.Academics and charitable groups dealing with the social fallout of the crisis say the bulk of the rise in deaths stems from misuse of prescription painkillers. That has put the onus on regulators in September to issue new rules cracking down on prescribing by doctors.“The goal is that these guidelines will provide evidence-based information on the proper number of opioid doses that should be dispensed,” Gottlieb said in a statement at the time.“Our goal is to help prevent patients from becoming addicted by decreasing unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to opioids.”Although the FDA contest is limited to devices and app-based solutions for pain and addiction, the current regulatory climate is also conducive to companies developing opioid-alternative pharmaceuticals.Drugmakers including Pfizer Inc, Eli Lilly and Co, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc have been packing their pipelines with potential solutions to the crisis and there are 120 non-opioid drugs under FDA review this year, up some 650 percent since 2013, according to business intelligence firm Informa.(Non-opioid drug applications surge png, tmsnrt.rs/2ReUI2H)Privately-held SPR Therapeutics Inc told Reuters it has entered its “temporary” neuromodulation device in the contest.

These range from Stimwave’s Halo to painkilling products made by Abbott Laboratories and other industry heavyweights as an alternative to opioids.“We’re pleased by the robust interest in this innovation challenge and the acknowledgement from developers about the unique and important role medical devices, including digital health technologies like mobile medical apps, have the potential to play in tackling the opioid crisis,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said.Perryman’s Halo devices, which look like angel hair pasta and are so small they can be injected into a nerve, took four years to get U.S. approval under other names for easing leg and back pain.She hopes a spot on the FDA program will see Halo approved within a year as an alternative to opioids, which are currently used to treat an estimated 50 percent of patients who come to emergency rooms with migraines.“This is kind of perfect for something like ours...since the device is shown to be safe already,” said Perryman, who founded privately-held Stimwave in South Florida seven years ago.The FDA has been increasingly reluctant to greenlight new opioids for market but earlier this month approved a potent opioid-based painkiller from AcelRx Pharmaceuticals Inc placing tight restrictions on its distribution and use. In a rare move, Gottlieb made a public statement at the time, explaining the decision.The regulator’s push for alternatives to opioids has helped drive interest from venture capital funds and institutional investors this year in firms promising to develop alternatives, according to interviews with device companies, financial services firms and brokerage Cowen & Co.For example, privately-held Virpax Pharmaceuticals, which makes an aerosol spray that delivers a non-opioid pain drug, said it had four or five banks interested in running its Series A investment round this summer versus just one in the past.Abbott, like rivals Boston Scientific Corp and Nevro Corp, makes neuromodulation implants which stimulate the nervous system to mask pain signals before they reach the brain.Abbott has submitted an entry for the competition in the hope it will slash waiting times, which often stretch several months just to get an initial meeting, according to Dr. Allen Burton, Abbott’s medical director of neuromodulation.“Devices that are part of this (program) will be streamlined... their meeting will go to the top of the pile,” said Burton.While neuromodulation is only a small part of Abbott’s large medical device business, the unit is seen as a growth engine for the company. Burton estimates between 10-to-20 percent of the growth Abbott has seen in its neuromodulation business could be tied to doctors prescribing its devices for pain after surgery or from injury to patients that are opioid averse.Boston Scientific did not apply for the contest, but the company is investing “heavily” in its neuromodulation unit, which was its fastest-growing at nearly 23 percent in the latest quarter, according to Maulik Nanavaty, senior vice president at the device maker.“We continue to make external investments in early (neuromodulation) technology,” he told Reuters.To be sure, these devices are not seen as a silver bullet for opioid addiction. Nirad Jain, a partner at consulting firm Bain & Co, believes many of the solutions on the table are just tinkering at the edges of a problem that needs to be solved by doctors simply settling for fewer or less potent opioids.Academics and charitable groups dealing with the social fallout of the crisis say the bulk of the rise in deaths stems from misuse of prescription painkillers. That has put the onus on regulators in September to issue new rules cracking down on prescribing by doctors.“The goal is that these guidelines will provide evidence-based information on the proper number of opioid doses that should be dispensed,” Gottlieb said in a statement at the time.“Our goal is to help prevent patients from becoming addicted by decreasing unnecessary or inappropriate exposure to opioids.”Although the FDA contest is limited to devices and app-based solutions for pain and addiction, the current regulatory climate is also conducive to companies developing opioid-alternative pharmaceuticals.Drugmakers including Pfizer Inc, Eli Lilly and Co, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Inc have been packing their pipelines with potential solutions to the crisis and there are 120 non-opioid drugs under FDA review this year, up some 650 percent since 2013, according to business intelligence firm Informa.(Non-opioid drug applications surge png, tmsnrt.rs/2ReUI2H)Privately-held SPR Therapeutics Inc told Reuters it has entered its “temporary” neuromodulation device in the contest. Similarly to Stimwave’s, its product is implanted into the body but can be surgically removed after about two months. Josh Boggs, a senior executive at the company, expects to get quicker feedback from the FDA and shorter review times in the wake of the crisis.After years in the business, he believes the crisis has increased the agency’s desire to collaborate with medical technology companies like his.“I feel like (FDA) people are coming well prepared to meetings and are very engaged in it. It feels like an atmosphere that’s conducive to finding a solution,” he said.(The story corrects third paragraph to say the deaths were from drug overdoses, not specifically opioid overdoses)"
2018-11-10,"New drug options, risk factors added to U.S. heart guidelines",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1XK1V4,"Nov 10 (Reuters) - Updated U.S. guidelines on heart health advise more personalized assessment of risk as well as potent cholesterol-lowering drugs for people at particularly high risk of heart attack or stroke.The recommendations from the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology, last issued in 2013, continue to avoid target levels for “bad” LDL cholesterol, which contributes to fatty plaque buildup and narrowing of arteries.The medical groups, which announced the guidelines on Saturday at the AHA’s annual meeting in Chicago, still emphasize a healthy diet and exercise as the first line of defense against heart disease, the No. 1 killer in the country.When cholesterol is not controlled by lifestyle efforts, patients are typically prescribed statin drugs, available as low cost generic pills that have long been proven to safely and effectively lower LDL levels and heart disease risk.For people who have had a heart attack or stroke, are at high risk for another and whose cholesterol levels are not adequately lowered by statins, the guidelines now recommend adding newer cholesterol drugs.Higher risk patients are advised to first try statins in combination with ezetimibe, the generic version of Zetia, which lowers cholesterol by limiting its absorption from the intestine. If that does not work, the guidelines call for newer injected medications known as PCSK9 inhibitors, specifically for people who are at very high risk or who have a genetic condition that causes very high cholesterol levels.Two PCSK9 drugs - Amgen Inc’s Repatha and Praluent from partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA - were launched in 2015 at U.S. prices of over $14,000 a year. Both have been shown to dramatically lower cholesterol levels, but uptake as been slower than expected as the medical community and health insurers questioned whether the prices were justified. To help spur usage, Amgen last month cut Repatha’s list price by 60 percent and Praluent’s annual net price was cut earlier this year to between $4,500 and $6,600.The guidelines update includes changes to a calculator introduced in 2013 to identify a patient’s 10-year risk for cardiovascular disease. In addition to traditional risk factors such as smoking and high blood pressure, doctors are now urged to discuss family history and ethnicity as well as health conditions such as chronic kidney disease and premature menopause.The guidelines call for cholesterol testing in children as young as two with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol, while other children should have an initial test between the ages of nine and 11.Coronary artery calcium measurements are advised for people whose risk level is not clear.The guidelines update has more specific recommendations for certain age and ethnic groups, as well as for people with diabetes.

2018-11-13,Express Scripts offers new formulary for lower list-price drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1NI1FQ,"(Reuters) - Express Scripts Holding Co on Tuesday announced a new drug reimbursement list with lower U.S. prices for brand-name medications, as a way to encourage drugmakers to move away from paying rebates after a prescription is filled. The manager of prescription drug benefits for large corporate employers and government health plans said its new National Preferred Flex Formulary will be available as of Jan. 1 to all clients.So far two drugs from a Gilead Sciences Inc unit will be on the new formulary, which Express Scripts said in a statement it hoped would encourage more drugmakers to keep list prices low.Drug rebates have come under fire from the Trump Administration and consumer groups as patients find themselves paying much higher insurance co-payments and deductibles tied to a drug’s sticker price.“This is all in an effort to normalize rebates in the marketplace,” Steve Miller, Express Scripts’ chief medical officer, said in an interview. “We have talked to dozens of pharmaceutical manufacturers. Many have expressed tremendous interest in this.”He said the new formulary may appeal to employers and health insurers seeking to reduce patient out-of-pocket costs and reliance on brand rebates, but plan sponsors who prefer the current price system and rebates “can stick to that.”He acknowledged that drugmakers would still offer rebates as a lever to influence payers deciding coverage terms for similar medications. The new coverage list is largely identical to Express Scripts’ National Preferred Formulary, which covers some 3,000 branded and generic drugs for nearly 25 million people.Gilead in September slashed the list prices of two hepatitis C therapies, Epclusa and Harvoni, to $24,000 per course of treatment from close to $100,000. The company said that competition among hepatitis C therapies, rebates and discounts had already shaved more than 60 percent off the average U.S. price paid for the drugs.At least one other drugmaker has cut list prices to limit patient costs and help make sure prescriptions get filled.Amgen Inc last month slashed the U.S. list price for its cholesterol drug Repatha by 60 percent to $5,850 a year, citing the need to reduce out-of-pocket costs for patients on Medicare, the federal government’s health plan for seniors.Rival cholesterol drug Praluent, from partners Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA (SASY.PA>, is the preferred option on Express Scripts’ largest formulary through 2019. But Miller said Amgen’s Repatha could displace Praluent on the new formulary.Miller said other categories in which lower list prices and minimal rebates would make sense for drugmakers, payers and patients are insulins, high-priced respiratory drugs and emergency allergy injections."
2018-11-24,Congo approves clinical trials for Ebola treatments,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1XZ0AF,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Congolese authorities have authorized clinical trials for four experimental Ebola treatments, which will allow researchers to collect valuable data about their effectiveness, the health ministry said on Saturday.Health workers have already administered therapeutic treatments to more than 150 Ebola patients since August in an effort to contain the worst of Democratic Republic of Congo’s 10 outbreaks of the hemorrhagic fever since 1976.But until now doctors have decided which treatment to use on a case-by-case basis. In the clinical trial, the choice of treatment will now be randomized.Treatment will still be free of charge, the ministry added in a statement.“Precious information about the effectiveness of the treatments obtained during the clinical trial will allow for the development of these treatments on a wider scale to save more lives,” the ministry said.The four treatments are mAb114, which was developed by the U.S. government; ZMapp, an intravenous treatment made by Mapp Biopharmaceutical; Remdesivir, made by Gilead Sciences; and Regeneron’s REGN-EB3.As of last weekend, 151 patients had received one of the four drugs. Of those, 76 had recovered, 44 had died and 31 were still hospitalized -- a mortality rate of 37 percent.By contrast, among those who had not received treatment, the mortality rate was close to 80 percent.The ministry said that the data from the current outbreak would probably not be sufficient to make definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of the treatments and that the trials could continue during future outbreaks.Despite the use of the treatments as well as an experimental vaccine manufactured by Merck, authorities have struggled to contain the outbreak due to widespread militia violence in eastern Congo and community resistance to health workers.At least 228 people are believed to have died, and the World Health Organization said last week that it expects the outbreak to last at least another six months."
2018-12-06,J&J unit to pay $360 mln to U.S. to resolve charity kickback probe,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1YB18Q,"BOSTON, Dec 6 (Reuters) - A unit of Johnson & Johnson has agreed to pay the U.S. government $360 million to resolve an investigation into its financial support of charities that help Medicare patients cover out-of-pocket drug costs, the U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday.The settlement with Actelion Pharmaceuticals US Inc, which became a subsidiary of J&J after the pharmaceutical giant acquired the biotech company in 2017, was the largest so far to result from an industry-wide probe into drugmakers’ support of patient assistance charities.The investigation, led by the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts, has led to allegations that several drugmakers used these charitable foundations as a means to pay Medicare patients’ co-pays in violation of the Anti-Kickback Statute.Actelion did not admit wrongdoing as part of the settlement. New Brunswick, New Jersey-based J&J did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the Medicare government healthcare program for the elderly. But companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.Amid increased attention to rising drug prices in the United States, concern has arisen that donations from drugmakers to patient-assistance groups may be contributing to price inflation.Thursday’s settlement surpassed the largest accord previously announced by the Department of Justice - an agreement by United Therapeutics Corp in December 2017 to pay $210 million to resolve claims it improperly used a charity to cover co-payments.Pfizer Inc in May resolved similar allegations for nearly $23.85 million. Jazz Pharmaceuticals Plc and Lundbeck earlier this year disclosed they had reached agreements to resolve similar claims for $57 million and $52.6 million, respectively.Several other drugmakers have, since 2015, disclosed receiving subpoenas as a result of the investigation, including Gilead Sciences Inc, Novartis AG, and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.

2018-3-10,Regeneron\\/Sanofi offer new Praluent pricing to break reimbursement logjam,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1GM0J5,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA said on Saturday they would be willing to charge less for their potent cholesterol drug, Praluent, if insurers agree to lessen onerous access barriers for high-risk patients.Since the approvals in 2015 of Praluent and a similar rival biotech drug from Amgen Inc, insurers and pharmacy benefit managers have been rejecting some 70 percent of prescriptions written, severely holding back sales and frustrating doctors and at-risk heart patients.Regeneron and Sanofi have decided to focus on patients at highest risk of a repeat heart attack or other major cardiovascular problems likely to derive the most benefit from significant lowering of “bad” LDL cholesterol in an attempt to break the reimbursement logjam.“We commit to working with all health plans that agree to remove access barriers for high-risk patients to offer a more cost-effective net price for Praluent,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said in a statement.“Inventing innovative medicines only matters if the people who need these products are able to access them, and that is unfortunately not the case with Praluent today,” he said.Amgen has offered various strategies in an effort to loosen payer purse strings, such as a willingness to reimburse the drug’s cost if a Repatha patient has a heart attack. But prescription rejections remain high as insurers worry about the cost of long-term treatment for potentially millions of patients.The new Praluent pricing would be tied to an independent review conducted by an organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines and be based on Praluent data unveiled on Saturday, the companies said.That data, presented at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Orlando, Florida, showed that for patients who have acute coronary syndrome, meaning a recent heart attack or serious chest pain episode, and are unable to get their “bad” LDL cholesterol below 100 despite taking maximum doses of statins, adding Praluent reduced the risk of death.Based on the new risk-reduction data seen in the huge, multi-year study, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) said an appropriate Praluent price for the highest risk patients would be $4,500 to $8,000 a year.That is considerably less than the more than $14,000 a year list price and presumably below current net prices with discounts and rebates.“We will begin working with payers to ensure that high-risk patients have appropriate access,” Sanofi CEO Olivier Brandicourt said in a statement."
2018-3-10,Regeneron\\/Sanofi heart drug succeeds in major trial; Will insurers pay?,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N1QR1ND,"March 10 (Reuters) - A potent, expensive cholesterol drug sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi significantly reduced major adverse heart events in a huge study presented on Saturday, but it remains to be seen whether the new data will prompt insurers to pay for increased use of the medicine.The drug, Praluent, also led to fewer deaths among high-risk patients, which could be the strongest argument for insurers to finally remove barriers that have severely constrained sales and frustrated physicians trying to get the medicine to patients.Insurers have balked at paying for cholesterol drugs like Praluent with list prices of more than $14,000 a year before discounts over fear they could be used for many years by millions of patients.The multi-year study, called Odyssey Outcomes, tested the injected biotech drug versus placebo in nearly 19,000 patients who had a recent heart attack or severe chest pain episode and were already on maximum doses of cholesterol-lowering statins, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor.The trial succeeded on its primary goal, reducing the combined risk of heart attack, stroke, heart disease-related death and chest pain requiring hospitalization by 15 percent.While the fewer heart-related deaths with Praluent did not reach statistical significance, there was a nominally significant reduction in all-cause deaths - 334 versus 392 for placebo, researchers reported.In a subgroup analysis of highest-risk patients - those with “bad” LDL cholesterol of 100 or above despite maximum statin therapy - Praluent significantly reduced all-cause death risk by 29 percent and risk of the adverse event composite by 24 percent.Those are the patients most likely to be prescribed the medicine, researchers said.“It matters tremendously to patients and physicians when there are fewer deaths in one column than the other,” said Dr. Phillippe Steg, the study’s co-chairman who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Orlando.“I think that will impress the field and people who have to make (reimbursement) decisions,” added Steg.Data presented on Amgen’s rival drug Repatha, which also has a list price of more than $14,000, showed that some 70 percent of prescriptions are being denied, even for those deemed at highest risk of serious heart problems. Praluent has faced the same issues.Regeneron and Sanofi shared the Odyssey results with ICER, an independent organization that evaluates clinical and cost effectiveness of new medicines, to seek its view based on the new findings.ICER’s updated report issued on Saturday found that for higher-risk patients $4,500 to $8,000 was an appropriate annual Praluent price based on the value of the benefits those patients receive. But for the larger at-risk population with LDL below 100 the cost should be $2,300 to $3,400, it said.A similar Repatha study in a slightly different patient population showed an identical 15 percent overall risk reduction but no death benefit.That trial, carried out over two years, showed a more pronounced risk reduction in the second year, leading some cardiologists to suggest a longer trial would have spawned better results. Odyssey followed patients on average for 3.3 years and the risk reduction versus placebo was greater over time.Artery clogging that leads to heart disease problems develops over decades, noted study co-chairman Dr. Gregory Schwartz.“It may be unrealistic to think it can be modified on the timeframe of a usual clinical trial. It may take years and years to really reap all the benefits that one can achieve,” Schwartz said.With an LDL target range of 25-50, rather than taking it as low as possible, three-quarters of patients were on a lower dose of Praluent and some were taken off the drug if their LDL remained at 15 or lower. It is unclear if benefits would have been more pronounced had more patients received the higher dose.The drug was deemed extremely safe with no difference from placebo in incidence of neurocognitive problems or new-onset diabetes.

2018-4-24,"Express Scripts targets Amgen, Lilly migraine drugs in pricing shift",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1HV0AT,"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The largest U.S. manager of prescription benefits is telling drugmakers that the current pricing model is broken, and taking aim at Amgen Inc, Eli Lilly and Co and other makers of new migraine medicines to try and fix it.Express Scripts told Reuters it is pressing them to forego the usual strategy of setting a high U.S. list price, then lowering the cost for health plans through hefty rebates. It is also seeking a refund if the drugs don’t work within a defined timeframe.The shift could help Express Scripts and other pharmacy benefits managers (PBMs) bring prices down, and deflect growing criticism of their role as “middlemen” in the drug supply chain.The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs.Express Scripts is advising drugmakers to take that shift into account as they launch a new class of migraine drugs.“If your expectation is that you are not going to actually get that high list price, then don’t do that to patients who have high co-pays,” Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller said in an interview, describing his message to Amgen and its rivals. “Let’s be more balanced. Let’s get back to where gross-to-net is not so different.”Amgen’s Aimovig is expected to be approved next month, followed by similar drugs from Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd and Lilly that the companies say could benefit up to 4 million people in the United States.Lilly has been pushing PBMs “for years” to create contracts that take drug performance into account, Chief Executive David Ricks said when analysts asked about the Reuters story on a conference call to discuss quarterly earnings.Ricks said he was happy that Express Scripts “is now changing their view and support this kind of construct. We’ll be happy to work with them on it.”The new injected therapies interfere with the function of a molecule involved in the processes that kick off a migraine, such as dilation of blood vessels in the brain.Wall Street analysts expect Amgen to announce a list price of up to $10,000 per year for Aimovig once it is approved, setting the tone for competitors.But Express Scripts and other PBMs restrict access to new drugs they deem too expensive, asking doctors to provide detailed evidence of why a specific patient may benefit, requiring the use of other drugs for a period of time or favoring cheaper rivals when available.Drugmakers could face similar issues with the new migraine treatments, Miller said: “Should they price these things too high they will probably not be able to achieve much market share.”Express Scripts is also pushing Amgen and its peers to refund two-thirds of the cost of a migraine drug if a patient stops treatment within 90 days because it didn’t work or caused major side effects.Such guarantees are becoming more prevalent for older drugs with competing products on the market, including diabetes and hepatitis C therapies. It would be unusual to introduce them for the first drug in an entirely new class of therapy.Amgen, which will market Aimovig in partnership with Novartis, declined to comment on talks with Express Scripts. Research chief Sean Harper said in a recent interview that payers share blame for the current pricing model.Their demands for ever-larger rebates has forced manufacturers to use higher list prices as a benchmark, he said.“It is a ridiculous situation that we are in,” Harper said. “No one is paying the list price, but patients are exposed for a period of time” until they pay off their insurance deductible.Shares of Amgen, which will report quarterly results on Tuesday afternoon, fell 1 percent in midday trading. Lilly declined 0.5 percent.Rising U.S. healthcare costs, the most expensive worldwide, are straining budgets for families, employers and government agencies. That has created new pressures within the industry to control costs.To that end, Express Scripts has agreed to a buyout from health insurer Cigna Corp, while PBM rival CVS Health Corp plans to buy insurer Aetna Inc .In interviews with Reuters, smaller PBM Abarca Health and insurer Highmark Health said they were adopting similar tactics to Express Scripts in negotiating coverage for the migraine drugs. CVS declined comment.Teva said it was evaluating the pricing environment for its migraine drug. The stakes are high for Amgen, which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years.The biotech company’s last potential blockbuster, high-priced cholesterol treatment Repatha, has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost $100 per year.Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death.As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million.“If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,” said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca.Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments, mainly low cost generic drugs. Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients.The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17. The agency’s decision on Teva’s treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June, but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues. A ruling on Lilly’s galcanezumab is expected later in the year."

The stakes are high for Amgen, which has struggled to grow revenue in recent years.The biotech company’s last potential blockbuster, high-priced cholesterol treatment Repatha, has been stymied by PBMs who questioned its value compared to generic statins that cost $100 per year.Repatha and rival Praluent, sold by Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, launched in 2015 at list prices near $14,000 a year and were expected to be billion-dollar products. But Express Scripts and other payers have rejected most prescriptions written for the new medicines while awaiting proof that they lower the risk of death.As a result, Repatha sales totaled $319 million last year, while Praluent had sales of $195 million.“If Amgen and Sanofi had it to do over again, I think they would have priced at half the list price and made a whole lot more money,” said Jason Borschow, chief executive officer at Miami-based Abarca.Aimovig is far more effective at preventing migraines than current treatments, mainly low cost generic drugs. Recent studies have shown that Aimovig reduces episodic migraines by at least half in around 50 percent of patients.The Food and Drug Administration is expected to decide on Aimovig by May 17. The agency’s decision on Teva’s treatment fremanezumab had been expected in June, but that may be delayed due to manufacturing issues. A ruling on Lilly’s galcanezumab is expected later in the year."

2018-5-01,"Regeneron\\/Sanofi cut heart drug price to $4,500-$6,600 for Express Scripts",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1S80L9,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA will slash the price of their expensive cholesterol drug for Express Scripts Holdings Co customers in exchange for greater patient access, with some savings to be shared with consumers, the companies said on Tuesday.The drug, Praluent, has a list price of over $14,000 a year, but the new price, after discounts and double-digit rebates, is on the “low end” of a $4,500 to $6,600 range, Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller told Reuters.That range was determined in March to be cost effective by the independent Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) for highest risk patients assuming the drug results in a sustained reduction in cardiovascular-related deaths.Praluent, given by injection, dramatically lowers bad LDL cholesterol and reduces the risk of heart attacks and death in high-risk heart patients.But sales of Praluent and a rival Amgen drug have been constrained by onerous roadblocks to patient access by insurers. They reject about 70 percent of prescriptions written, the companies have said.“I expect this to substantially increase the sales,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said of the deal.But investors are less certain that big price concessions will result in an overall sales increase. Amgen shares were off 3.3 percent, or $5.81, at $168.67 while Regeneron shares fell 2.5 percent, or $7.59 to $296.09.The new arrangement makes Praluent exclusive on the Express Scripts’ national formulary for the drug class known as PCSK9 inhibitors, meaning some customers of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) will not easily access Amgen’s Repatha.Express Scripts, the nation’s largest manager of pharmacy benefit plans (PBM), said about 25 million people, or a third of its customers, are covered by the preferred formulary.Miller said in a telephone interview that the new Praluent price includes “point of sale” discounts for consumers. Beginning in July, Express Scripts will pass along a portion of Praluent rebates it receives from the drugmakers to people in eligible health benefit plans, lowering out-of-pocket costs.“This is a significant (price) reduction that the patients will also feel, not just the insurance companies or the employers,” Schleifer told Reuters by telephone.The Trump administration and members of Congress have demanded that PBMs pass on more of the rebates they receive to consumers outraged over rising costs at the pharmacy counter. Many Americans now have health plans with higher deductibles or co-payments, making them responsible for more of their medical costs.Other insurers and PBMs, including UnitedHealth, and CVS Health, have announced plans to return at least some prescription drug rebates back to consumers.Amgen said the formulary decision impacts 2,000 Repatha patients out of the 39,000 people who take the drug. It said it has been negotiating with several payers and that it will fight to be included in other Express Scripts business, and that it is offering significant discounts.Regeneron and Sanofi said in March they would be willing to lower Praluent’s price in exchange for easier patient access.Beginning July 1, doctors can submit just one form attesting that a patient with heart disease meets criteria for PCSK9 therapy, such as inability to sufficiently lower LDL with cheap statins, like generic versions of Pfizer’s Lipitor.Regeneron’s CEO said talks were taking place with other insurers and PBMs about similar arrangements.“I hope that this will spread like wildfire through the entire payer system,” Schleifer said."

They said pricing could be tied to an independent review by the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), which put an appropriate Praluent price for highest risk patients at $4,500 to $8,000 a year.The Praluent net price will be at the “low end” of the ICER range including double-digit rebates, said Express Scripts Chief Medical Officer Steve Miller. Rebates are still needed to reward plans for choosing the drug, he added.The arrangement makes Praluent exclusive on the Express Scripts’ national formulary for the drug class known as PCSK9 inhibitors, meaning customers of the largest U.S. pharmacy benefit manager (PBM) will mostly not have access to Amgen’s Repatha.Beginning July 1, doctors can submit just one form attesting that a patient with heart disease meets criteria for PCSK9 therapy, such as inability to sufficiently lower LDL with cheap statins, like Pfizer’s Lipitor.“This ... addresses head-on the frustrations caused by complex pre-authorization requirements that hamstring physicians and put an important medicine out of reach from patients,” Michelle Carnahan, head of Sanofi’s North America cardiovascular business, said in a statement.Starting next year, Express Scripts will pass along a portion of Praluent rebates it receives from the drugmakers to people in eligible health benefit plans, lowering out-of-pocket costs.“This is a significant (price) reduction that the patients will also feel, not just the insurance companies or the employers,” Schleifer said.He said talks were taking place with other insurers and PBMs about similar arrangements.“I hope that this will spread like wildfire through the entire payer system,” Schleifer said."

2018-5-03,"Regeneron\'s newer drugs disappoint, shares slip",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1I4155,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O disappointed Wall Street with lower-than-expected sales of its newer treatments, eczema medicine Dupixent and heart drug Praluent, exacerbating concerns over the company's future sales growth as its best-selling eye drug Eylea faces more competition. The drugmaker’s shares, down 21 percent this year, fell about 2 percent in mid-day trade on Thursday.Regeneron is bracing for a hit to Eylea’s sales by focusing on expanding Dupixent’s label to reach more patients and venturing into the hot new field of immuno-oncology with a potential regulatory approval later this year.“There are concerns that what happened (with Dupixent) in first quarter could happen again,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst Yatin Suneja said, adding that there could possibly be an issue with the long term growth potential of the drug.Dupixent’s quarterly sales of $131 million, reported last week by partner Sanofi, missed estimates of $167.6 million, a worrying sign that the expensive drug might be facing similar issues like the company’s pricey drug Praluent.Just two days ago, Regeneron and partner Sanofi SA SASY.PA slashed the price on Praluent by more than half for Express Scripts ESRX.O customers, an aggressive attempt to boost sales of the drug.Praluent earned $60 million in first-quarter revenue, falling short of expectations of $66 million, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.One bright spot for Regeneron was Eylea sales, which rose 15 percent to $984 million, beating estimates of $922.4 million.While Eylea has driven much of Regeneron's growth for more than seven years, competition from Lucentis, a rival treatment from Roche AG ROG.S and Novartis AG NOVN.S, remain a worry for analysts and investors. “There’s even more competition on the horizon for Eylea, so we are looking at Dupixent as a growth driver,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay said.The company said it is unlikely to be active in dealmaking and instead will rely on its own drug pipeline even as large drugmakers across the world spend big to acquire nimbler, smaller rivals.“Our strategy was, and continues to be, to invest heavily in our internal research capabilities rather than look externally for new products,” Chief Executive Officer Leonard Schleifer said on a conference call with analysts.“We are not nearly as desperate as other companies are to fill up gaps in the pipeline.”Regeneron’s net income rose 92 percent to $478 million.Excluding one-time items, the company earned $4.67 per share, ahead of estimates of $4.35.Revenue rose to $1.51 billion, edging past estimates of $1.50 billion."

2018-5-10,Setback to Roche hopes for Tecentriq as fails key cancer trial,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N1SH29P,"* Tecentriq fails colorectal cancer trial* Dents Roche’s immunotherapy expansion aims* Field of immunotherapies growing more crowdedZURICH, May 10 (Reuters) - Roche’s hopes of its Tecentriq immunotherapy catching up rival medicines from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb were dealt a blow on Thursday after it failed a key combination trial.Roche was evaluating the use of Tecentriq and its targeted drug Cotellic against colorectal cancer, a big market with some 1.4 million new cases diagnosed globally in 2012 and 694,000 deaths, according to an International Journal of Cancer study.The Swiss company said its Phase III IMblaze370 study did not boost overall survival compared to Bayer’s Stivarga in advanced or metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in which patients had failed previous treatments.Roche Chief Medical Officer Sandra Hornung acknowledged the results “are not what we hoped for,” but vowed to press ahead with other medicines being developed for colorectal cancer.Tecentriq is already approved for some lung cancer patients and bladder cancer, but Roche, the world’s biggest oncology drugs maker, is running multiple trials of the immunotherapy as it seeks to expand it range of uses. Trials against some lung cancers and kidney cancer have produced recent, important wins, but difficult-to-treat CRC proved elusive.Barclays Capital analysts, who rate Roche shares “overweight”, called the failure a disappointment but said CRC was always seen as a higher-risk opportunity, with only modest expectations of the indication adding significantly to sales.Roche, which is weathering patent losses on its best selling medicines Herceptin, Rituxan and Avastin that open the market to copies, is looking for Tecentriq to make up ground to Merck’s Keytruda and Opdivo from Bristol-Myers Squibb.Each has more than ten times the quarterly sales of Tecentriq which were 139 million Swiss francs ($138 million) in the first three months of 2018.Tecentriq is also facing an increasingly crowded market for checkpoint inhibitors, amid a fast expanding field of cancer drugs as more and more companies focus on what is one of medicine’s most-lucrative markets.Beyond Opdivo and Keytruda, there are two other so-called PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitors on the market: AstraZeneca’s Imfinzi, Pfizer and Merck KGaA’s Bavencio. These could soon to be joined by a sixth, with Regeneron’s and Sanofi’s cemiplimab under review in the United States and Europe.There are also molecules under development in China by companies like Beigene Ltd.Moreover, Novartis has similar checkpoint inhibitors in the works as part of plans to have its own medicines to be used in combination therapies seen likely to dominate the next phase of cancer treatment.

2018-5-29,Almost all in Congo city at immediate risk of Ebola now vaccinated -WHO,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1IU1IT,"GENEVA (Reuters) - The World Health Organization said on Tuesday almost all the people it considers at immediate risk from an Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo city of Mbandaka have now been vaccinated against the disease.More than 400 potential Ebola contacts have been vaccinated, which represents 90 percent of those considered at risk, said Peter Salama, WHO Deputy Director-General for Emergency Preparedness and Response.“We can’t conclude that we’ve safeguarded the city of Mbandaka but we can say that so far there has not been an explosive increase in cases. So that’s a positive sign and a positive development,” he said.“We have reason to be cautiously optimistic.”Ebola spreads easily through bodily fluids. The medical strategy involves ringfencing patients by vaccinating all the people they may have infected, and then vaccinating a second “ring” of contacts around each of those potential sufferers.That would include family members but also people who may have come into contact with a sufferer in church or on public transport, each a potential Ebola time-bomb who must be found and vaccinated by virus-hunting experts.Twenty-five people have died in the outbreak, which is the largest since more than 11,300 people died of Ebola in Guinea, Sierra Leone and Liberia in an outbreak that reached its peak in 2014.The outbreak has so far caused 54 cases of the disease, and 47 of those have been in the rural communities of Bikoro and Iboko, which is where the outbreak was first declared and where the priority must be in the next few weeks, he said.WHO Assistant Director-General Michael Ryan described the change of focus as a double-edged sword, because the disease could spread faster in a city but at least the population was easy to access.“In a rural area, it’s not as dangerous but finding the cases and the contacts becomes a nightmare,” he said.There was a need much for a much stronger Ebola response in the rural town of Itipo, which had a population of around 10,000, he said.Salama also said the WHO hoped to get government approval within days to use five experimental drugs to treat Ebola patients, in a clinical trial which could lay the groundwork for rapid treatment of Ebola patients in future outbreaks.“If we don’t use the opportunity to learn in this situation we will never be able know which is better than the other,” Salama said.But the trial would be complicated, with some drugs requiring 6-12 hours of daily intravenous infusions and daily assessment of liver and kidney function.“Remember where we’re talking about: Bikoro has no power, no functioning lab, and very little infrastructure,” Salama said.Ryan said some drugs were already in Congo and he hoped potentially life-saving therapies would be available in Ebola treatment centers within “a very short number of days”.A WHO spokesman said the drugs were the antivirals Remdesivir, developed by Gilead Sciences, and Favipiravir, developed by Toyama Chemical Co, the monoclonal antibody mAB114, and two monoclonal antibody cocktails: ZMapp and a drug developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals known as REGN3470-3471-3479."

2018-6-13,Sanofi says on track to regain solid position in cancer drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1J90VS,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi believes it can make a comeback and re-establish a leading position in the competitive cancer drug market on the back of its immunotherapy drugs and efforts in new areas such as molecular oncology.“We missed the immunology wagon in recent years but we are committed to catching up and we have a significant number of assets,” Jorge Insuasty, Sanofi’s global head of development, told journalists on Wednesday.Sanofi is working on 10 new cancer medicines. Only one of them, however - immunotherapy agent Cemiplimab, submitted along with U.S partner Regeneron and designed to treat cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma - has made it to a review process in the United States and the European Union.Cancer immunotherapy has become the fastest-growing part of the $100 billion-a-year cancer drug market, with sales expected to top $25 billion by 2021, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.Such prospects have led to relentless competition and experts warn many drugmakers are often following the same targets. For investors, this translates into greater scepticism and a need for ever more thorough analysis.Because many firms are using similar molecular pathways in immunotherapy, the challenge is now to come up with smart combinations of drugs to succeed in fighting cancer.This has proven a challenge so far. Earlier this year, a study showed an experimental drug developed by U.S Incyte had failed to bolster the effectiveness of Merck & Co’s blockbuster Keytruda to treat skin cancer patients.Switzerland’s Roche also failed a key combination trial last month in colorectal cancer."
2018-6-20,Latecomer Sanofi looks to catch next wave of cancer therapies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1JG0GR,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi missed the boat on immune system-boosting cancer drugs. Now it’s trying to catch up.The French drugmaker has hired John Reed, the former top scientist at oncology market leader Roche to head its group research operations. And it is now focusing on a pipeline of 10 medicines that it hopes will help it get a piece of the $100 billion-a-year cancer drug market.Dmitri Wiederschain, head of Sanofi’s immuno-oncology research, acknowledged the company had failed to capitalize on the takeoff of immunotherapy - drugs that activate the body’s immune system to attack tumor cells - in the early 2010s.But he said the group could now gain an edge in the next waves of immunotherapy treatments, which include combining different drugs to better target cancer.“It is of course a very competitive space but we now have ‘foundation assets’ to form a better rationale for combinations,” he told Reuters in an interview, citing immunotherapy approaches known as PD-1, TGFBeta and the antibody CD38.“If you look across the biopharmaceutical landscape, Sanofi is the only company which has all three assets in its own pipeline or partnered with Regeneron,” Wiederschain said. Sanofi teamed with U.S firm Regeneron in 2007 to increase its presence in biotech medicine.Immunotherapy is the fastest-growing part of the cancer drug segment, with sales expected to top $25 billion-a-year by 2021, according to analyst forecasts compiled by Thomson Reuters.Frederic Ponchon, a manager at Sycomore Asset Management which holds 6.7 million Sanofi shares, said the French company was unlikely to rival cancer leaders like Switzerland’s Roche and U.S. firm Merck & Co soon.“They could enjoy occasional breakthroughs but it won’t carry a lot of weight in their overall sales,” he said.“We can see that Sanofi takes cancer seriously but you must remember R&D cycles are very long. So I would say Sanofi won’t be a great player in oncology but it may have some successes from time to time.”Sanofi’s main business areas include drugs for diabetes, heart diseases and vaccines, with cancer treatments making up only about 4 percent of sales. Its cancer drug sales totaled $1.7 billion last year, compared with Roche’s $25.9 billion.Sanofi has not always been behind the curve in oncology; in the 1990s, it produced top-selling cancer drugs such as Taxotere and Eloxatin.However it has been seven years since the company launched its last one, Zaltrap, which targets metastatic colorectal cancer and had sales of 75 million euros ($87 million) last year.In the meantime, companies such as Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck & Co have developed their immunotherapy blockbusters. New treatments, if successful, can fetch more than $100,000 a year.In Sanofi’s current cancer pipeline, only one has made it to regulatory review in the United States and the European Union: immunotherapy agent cemiplimab to treat cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Regeneron is its partner on the project.The company expects to submit for U.S. regulatory review another of its cancer candidates, isatuximab, to treat multiple myeloma later this year or in early 2019.With over 2,000 drugs in the cancer immunotherapy space, the competitive landscape has never been more crowded as each firm seeks its own proprietary version of often similar drugs.“There is clearly huge market potential but also a very large number of players, it is the toughest issue here,” Nicolas Baudouin, a director at ratings agency Standard & Poor’s said of immunotherapy.Many of the immunotherapy drugs work in only a minority of patients, which companies hope to improve by combining drugs that target tumors in different ways.This area, where Sanofi says it can be successful, has proven a challenge for drugmakers so far. Earlier this year, a study showed an experimental drug developed by U.S Incyte had failed to bolster the effectiveness of Merck’s blockbuster Keytruda to treat skin cancer patients.Roche also failed a key combination trial last month in colorectal cancer.Wiederschain said molecular oncology, which targets a tumor based on its genetic makeup, would also be a future differentiator.“It is about understanding better what drives the growth of cancer tissues, how the cells works and proliferation in the body.”This has led Sanofi to launch early-stage trials in breast cancer using molecular oncology technology.Newly appointed research chief Reed will start the job on July 1, when industry veteran Elias Zerhouni retires.Under Zerhouni’s leadership, Sanofi has tried to improve research and development productivity but still struggled to find enough new products to offset the impact of weak diabetes drug sales.It has also been looking to acquisitions to fill its pipeline.It struck two big deals in January, agreeing to buy U.S haemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and Belgium’s Ablynx, which is developing an experimental drug for a rare blood disorder, for 3.9 billion euros."
2018-7-19,"Allergan, Molecular Partners eye drug meets main goal in two studies",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N1UF4CR,"(Reuters) - Allergan Plc and Molecular Partners AG said on Thursday their treatment for neovascular age-related macular degeneration, a leading cause of vision loss among people over 65, met the main goal in two late-stage studies.The drug, abicipar, demonstrated that both the 8-week and 12-week treatment regimens met the goal of non-inferiority to Roche Holding AG and Novartis AG’s Lucentis.The current market is dominated by Lucentis and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ Eylea.The two companies, however, said that incidence of intraocular inflammations in patients taking abicipar was higher compared to those taking Lucentis in both trials.Abicipar demonstrated similar effectiveness after six or eight injections, compared to 13 Lucentis injections in the first year of the study, the company said.The regulatory filing for the treatment is planned for the first half of 2019 and Allergan will be requesting a meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to discuss submission of its marketing application."
2018-7-31,Genzyme rare disease drug sales drive Sanofi profit,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1KL0KT,"PARIS (Reuters) - Strong sales growth at Sanofi's SASY.PA Genzyme rare diseases business drove better than expected second quarter profit, allowing the French drugmaker to narrow its 2018 target.Sanofi, which has been hurt by declining diabetes sales and a struggle to find enough new products in recent years, confirmed on Tuesday it was poised for stronger growth in the second half as it builds upon acquisitions made earlier this year.Although there was some market relief at the results, shares in Sanofi were down 0.22 percent at 0741 GMT. The stock is up almost 3 percent year-to-date.“Overall, investors were nervous of a worse result. As we have previously said this is a ‘show me story’ and the company is showing us that they can generally deliver on promises,” Deutsche Bank analysts wrote in a note to clients.In January Sanofi bought U.S hemophilia specialist Bioverativ for $11.6 billion and Belgium’s Ablynx, which is developing an experimental drug for a rare blood disorder, for 3.9 billion euros ($4.57 billion).Sanofi is awaiting regulatory approval for Ablynx’s Cablivi (caplacizumab) for the treatment of acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP), which can be fatal. Ablynx had forecast peak caplacizumab sales of 1.2 billion euros, although Sanofi said in January it was premature to make a prediction.The European Medicines Agency’s Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) last month recommended the approval of caplacizumab, while the U.S Food & Drug Administration (FDA), which has granted the drug a ‘Fast Track’ designation, is expected to follow suit in early 2019.Sanofi believes some 7,500 patients present acquired TTP symptoms across the United States, the European Union and Japan and it hopes to launch caplacizumab in Germany later this year.The drugmaker said its second-quarter business net income was up 0.4 percent at constant exchange rates at 1.558 billion euros, while revenue was up 0.1 percent at 8.176 billion.Sales at Genzyme surged 33.1 percent to 1.8 billion euros with revenue from Dupixent, developed in partnership with U.S Regeneron REGN.O for atopic dermatitis, reaching 176 million euros and beating market expectations by 12 percent.Vaccines revenue, however, fell 15.7 percent, hit by the supply constraint of a combination infant vaccine in China. Diabetes and cardiovascular sales were down 15.6 percent.Analysts polled by Reuters in partnership with Inquiry Financial had on average been expecting a business net income of 1.536 billion euros on revenue of 8.279 billion.Sanofi, which had last quarter predicted earnings per share growth this year of 2 to 5 percent, said it now expects a 3-5 percent target range."

We don’t see (the lack of) it as, in any way, a negative to our current profile,” she added.U.S. sales of Eylea, which has driven much of Regeneron’s growth since late 2011, increased 8 pct to $992 million in the second quarter, but missed consensus estimates of $1 billion, according to brokerage SunTrust Robinson Humphrey.Based on net sales, Eylea currently accounts for about 70 percent of the overall U.S. market for anti-VEGF treatments, a class of medicines that reduce new blood vessel growth or swelling, the company said.Sales of Regeneron’s eczema treatment Dupixent jumped to $209 million, up from $28 million last year and ahead of consensus estimates of $187 million, helped by its launch in new markets.Right now Regeneron is focusing on launching its new drugs but it’s also looking at keeping Eylea competitive, RBC Capital Markets analyst Kennen MacKay said.In the second quarter ended June 30, Regeneron’s net income rose about 42 percent to $551.4 million, or $4.82 per share.Excluding items, the drugmaker earned $5.45 per share, topping the average analyst estimate of $4.70.Total revenue rose 9.3 pct to $1.61 billion, beating estimates of $1.56 billion."

2018-8-17,Regeneron\'s anti-blindness drug approved for less frequent treatments,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N1TA42D,"Aug 17 (Reuters) - Regeneron said on Friday it had won U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for less-frequent applications of its Eylea anti-blindness treatment, which may come under pressure from a rival product made by NovatisThis marks a turnaround from earlier in the week when the U.S. regulator had issued a complete response letter which indicated it was not yet satisfied with the information provided by Regeneron. Regeneron did not give any reason for the change in its statement on Friday.The go-ahead was based on second-year data from the so-called VIEW 1 and 2 trials, showing patients with wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) can be treated with a modified 12-week dosing schedule.Eylea is currently approved in wet AMD for dosing intervals of every four or eight weeks after three initial monthly doses.Regeneron’s Partner Bayer, for its part, earlier this month won approval in Europe for Eylea also to be injected less frequently.This could be a relief for patients of wet AMD, the leading cause of blindness in the elderly, as the drug is given as injections into the eye.In November, Novartis’s rival eye drug brolucizumab, also known as RTH258, was shown to lead to less disease activity than Eylea. According to previous study results, brolucizumab could be injected less frequently than Eylea.Regeneron sells the drug in the U.S. and Bayer in the rest of the world. Wet AMD leads to abnormal blood vessels that leak fluid into the eye and cause blindness.Regeneron reported 2017 U.S. revenue of $3.7 billion from the drug. With sales of 1.88 billion euros ($2.14 billion) in 2017 for Bayer, Eylea is the German group’s second-biggest selling drug after stroke prevention pill Xarelto.

2018-8-22,Congo approves more experimental Ebola treatments,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1L72EH,"KINSHASA (Reuters) - Democratic Republic of Congo has approved four more experimental treatments against the deadly Ebola virus, the health ministry said as it raced to contain an outbreak in its violence-torn east.Health authorities last week started administering the U.S.-developed mAb114 treatment to Ebola patients, the first time such a treatment had been used against an active outbreak.The health ministry said in a daily bulletin late on Tuesday that the 10 patients who received mAb114 since Aug. 11 have experienced a “positive evolution,” but the outbreak has continued to grow.The four additional treatments approved by Congo’s ethics committee are Remdesivir, made by U.S.-based Gilead Sciences; ZMapp, an intravenous treatment made by San Diego’s Mapp Pharmaceutical; Japanese drug Favipiravir; and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ Regn3450 – 3471 – 3479.Remdesivir was administered to its first patient in the town of Beni on Tuesday, who is doing well, the ministry said in its bulletin.The ministry said on Wednesday that one new case and two new deaths had been confirmed from the hemorrhagic fever, which causes vomiting and severe diarrhea, bringing the total number of deaths to 61 and confirmed cases to 76 since last month.Congo, whose heavily forested interior makes its a natural home for Ebola, is at the forefront of a global campaign to combat the virus, which killed more than 11,000 people when it swept through West Africa from 2013-2016.The Central African country has experienced ten Ebola outbreaks since the virus was discovered in northern Congo in 1976 - more than twice as many as any other country - and 33 people died in a flare-up in the northwest that ended last month.In addition, a vaccine manufactured by Merck, which proved effective against the earlier outbreak in northwestern Congo, has been administered to 2,179 health workers and contacts of Ebola patients.In a statement after a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, government spokesman Lambert Mende said that about 5,000 doses of the vaccine remained available.Insecurity in Congo’s eastern borderlands with Uganda has continued to complicate the response, with some contacts of Ebola patients located in so-called “red-zones”, which are off limits to emergency responders due to militia activity.Instead, local health workers in those areas are monitoring the contacts and no Ebola cases have yet been confirmed there."

The bestseller’s patent expires in 2024.Sales of eye drug Eylea, the second-most important product, could peak over the next three years as a promising drug by Novartis, brolucizumab, could take market share in treating the most common form of blindness in the elderly.The Swiss drugmaker is also working on another experimental drug, RG7716, against the disease.Bayer’s campaign to follow-up with new drug hopefuls has seen some setbacks. It dropped plans with its partner Regeneron REGN.O to combine Eylea with another drug after a mid-stage trial failed to show a benefit. (Full Story)Anetumab ravtansine, a drug for asbestos-linked cancer type mesothelioma, failed a Phase II trial.A trial designed to widen the use of prostate cancer drug Xofigo, which was tested in combination with certain hormonal treatments, had to be stopped early because of side effects late last year.Roundup cancer verdictBayer shares plunged after newly acquired Monsanto was ordered to pay close to $300 million in damages in the first of possibly thousands of U.S. lawsuits over alleged links between the Roundup weedkiller and cancer.Bayer vowed to challenge the verdict, saying it was at odds with scientific evidence and regulators’ conclusions.FDA rebukeThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration in February sent Bayer a warning letter over sub-standard production procedures at its Leverkusen, Germany headquarters. Addressing the FDA’s issues will likely be a 300 million euro drag on operating profit this year.Essure birth control device pullBayer in July started phasing out the sale in the United States of Essure, the birth control device at the center of more than 16,000 U.S. lawsuits over alleged injuries. Bayer said that only commercial reasons were behind the market exit and that it stands behind the product’s safety.It had previously started winding down the Essure business in other markets. Bayer in 2013 bought Essure maker Conceptus Inc for $1.1 billion to shore up its women’s healthcare business.Declining consumer care businessBayer’s consumer care division, bolstered by the 2014 acquisition of a Merck & Co Inc MRK.N division for $14 billion, has seen revenues slip as U.S. consumers switched from established drugstores to online shops to hunt for bargains.Bayer brought in former Nestle manager Heiko Schipper this year to turn the business around but supply disruptions in the wake of the rebuke by U.S. regulators have made that job tougher.Dicamba weedkiller litigationU.S. farmers have filed class action lawsuits against Monsanto and other makers of dicamba-based weedkillers, claiming crops were damaged by neighbors’ use of dicamba, after millions of acres were affected.The launch of dicamba and seeds that can resist it was Monsanto’s answer to the spread of aggressive weeds that have grown resistant to established glyphosate weedkillers such as Roundup.Dicamba evaporates easily and travels to off-target plants but makers of newer versions, including DowDuPont DWDP.N and BASF BASFn.DE, say the issue was resolved - provided farmers adhere to label instructions."

2019-1-03,UPDATE 7-Bristol-Myers to buy Celgene for $74 bln in largest biopharma deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N1Z32RL,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY.N said on Thursday it would buy Celgene Corp CELG.O for about $74 billion, combining two of the world's largest cancer drug businesses in the biggest pharmaceutical deal ever.Both Bristol-Myers and Celgene face separate challenges, and some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the combination - which the companies said would create $2.5 billion in cost savings and significantly raise earnings - would solve them. Amid clinical setbacks and other missteps, Bristol-Myers shares fell 15.2 percent in 2018 while Celgene plunged nearly 40 percent last year.Bristol's most important cancer immunotherapy and growth driver, Opdivo, has lost much of its luster as Merck & Co's MRK.N rival drug Keytruda seized dominance in advanced lung cancer, the most lucrative oncology market. Meanwhile, Celgene has endured high-profile clinical failures and U.S. exclusivity on its flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid, will start being phased out in 2022.On Thursday, Bristol’s stock ended another 13.3 percent lower at $45.12. “Doing this transaction clearly indicates that risk to Opdivo in lung cancer is obviously a concern,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said in an interview.There is also shareholder concern that drugs in development would not have enough sales to offset major products losing exclusivity between 2022 and 2026.But cash flow from Revlimid buys Bristol-Myers time to pay down debt and position for another transaction, Boris said. Revlimid is expected to record nearly $10 billion in 2018 sales.Celgene shares were up 20.7 percent at $89.43.“Both of them were coming into this year kind of limping,” said Brad Loncar, who runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. The deal makes “the combined entity a lot stronger,” he added.Including debt, the deal is worth $95 billion, eclipsing Pfizer's $89 billion purchase of Warner-Lambert in 2000, according to Refinitiv.

2019-1-04,Bristol-Myers to buy Celgene for $74 billion in largest biopharma deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1OX0VM,"(Reuters) - Bristol-Myers Squibb Co BMY.N said on Thursday it would buy Celgene Corp CELG.O for about $74 billion, combining two of the world's largest cancer drug businesses in the biggest pharmaceutical deal ever.Both Bristol-Myers and Celgene face separate challenges, and some Wall Street analysts questioned whether the combination - which the companies said would create $2.5 billion in cost savings and significantly raise earnings - would solve them. Amid clinical setbacks and other missteps, Bristol-Myers shares fell 15.2 percent in 2018 while Celgene plunged nearly 40 percent last year.Bristol's most important cancer immunotherapy and growth driver, Opdivo, has lost much of its luster as Merck & Co's MRK.N rival drug Keytruda seized dominance in advanced lung cancer, the most lucrative oncology market. Meanwhile, Celgene has endured high-profile clinical failures and U.S. exclusivity on its flagship multiple myeloma drug, Revlimid, will start being phased out in 2022.On Thursday, Bristol’s stock ended another 13.3 percent lower at $45.12. “Doing this transaction clearly indicates that risk to Opdivo in lung cancer is obviously a concern,” SunTrust Robinson Humphrey analyst John Boris said in an interview.There is also shareholder concern that drugs in development would not have enough sales to offset major products losing exclusivity between 2022 and 2026.But cash flow from Revlimid buys Bristol-Myers time to pay down debt and position for another transaction, Boris said. Revlimid is expected to record nearly $10 billion in 2018 sales.Celgene shares were up 20.7 percent at $89.43.“Both of them were coming into this year kind of limping,” said Brad Loncar, who runs the Loncar Cancer Immunotherapy ETF. The deal makes “the combined entity a lot stronger,” he added.Including debt, the deal is worth $95 billion, eclipsing Pfizer's $89 billion purchase of Warner-Lambert in 2000, according to Refinitiv.

2019-1-07,U.S. top court rejects Amgen over cholesterol medication patent fight,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N1Z70LG,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Amgen Inc on Monday lost its bid at the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn a ruling that kept the Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA cholesterol-lowering drug Praluent on the market, but the patent dispute among the rival drugmakers will continue in another trial.The justices declined to hear Amgen’s appeal seeking reinstatement of a jury verdict it won against Regeneron and Sanofi in the dispute in which Amgen accused its rivals of infringing its patents relating to its competing drug Repatha and sought to block sales of Praluent.Amgen had asked the justices to overturn a 2017 decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit that set aside the jury’s verdict, nullified a ban imposed by a judge on Praluent sales and ordered a new trial. The sales ban was put on hold while the matter was on appeal, never taking effect.Sanofi and Regeneron said in a joint statement they were pleased with the Supreme Court’s action.“We are confident that the law and the facts support our positions,” the companies said, adding that they look forward to the next trial in federal court in Delaware that is scheduled to start on Feb. 19.Amgen said in a statement it believed in the validity of its patents and was preparing for the new trial.Praluent is an injectable drug approved by the FDA in 2015 to treat high cholesterol in patients whose cholesterol levels were not controlled by diet and statin treatment. It is created from antibodies that dramatically lower levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol in the blood by blocking a certain protein.Thousand Oaks, California-based Amgen sued Regeneron and Sanofi in 2014. A jury returned a verdict in 2016 that Amgen’s patents relating to Repatha were valid. Paris-based Sanofi and Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron had stipulated that if the patents were valid Praluent had infringed them.In January 2018, U.S. District Judge Sue Robinson in Delaware took the unusual step of ordering an end to sales of Praluent. Robinson found that, although having both drugs on the market would be in the public interest, Amgen’s patent rights outweighed that concern.Praluent and Repatha won U.S. approval to reduce LDL cholesterol and have been shown to lower the risk of heart attacks. The drugs are far more costly than other cholesterol drugs, with a list price topping $14,000 annually."

2019-10-08,CORRECTED-Novartis gets FDA boost in crowded eye drug market,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL5N26T0K5,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s anti-blindness medicine Beovu has become the latest eye drug to win U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, giving the Swiss drugmaker a boost in the increasingly competitive market for eye problems among an aging population.Beovu injections into the eye treat wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), which affects 20 million people worldwide, the Swiss drugmaker said on Tuesday.With the FDA’s blessing, Beovu joins blockbuster predecessors Lucentis, which Novartis sells with Roche, and Eylea from both Bayer and Regeneron, in the AMD market. Drugs gain blockbuster status if their sales top $1 billion.More rivals are coming. Roche has a refillable Lucentis “port” implant as well as its drug candidate faricimab. Allergan and Swiss-based Molecular Partners have filed with U.S. and European regulators for abicipar. Lucentis and Eylea copycats are waiting in the wings for patent expirations.Also, in Britain and elsewhere, some doctors can use Avastin, a Roche drug that works much like Lucentis, but is cheaper.“The market for AMD is growing strongly as a consequence of an aging population and lacking preventative procedures and is currently worth around $9 billion annually,” Zuercher Kantonalbank analyst Michael Nawrath said. “In the next 10 years, the market is expected to double in size.”Beovu’s list price is around $11,100 for the first year and $7,400 annually thereafter when injected by an eye doctor every three months, a level Novartis says is comparable to Eylea.Just over half of patients in Novartis’s studies maintained quarterly dosing at the one-year mark with Beovu, it said, with the rest going to dosing every two months.Eylea is also approved for quarterly dosing after the first year, though that is not as effective as once every two months, based on instructions to doctors on how to use it.Novartis sees Beovu as a $1 billion-plus annual seller because Lucentis and Eylea brought in some $3.7 billion and about $6.4 billion respectively from global sales in 2018.Novartis says Beovu, also known as RTH258 or brolucizumab, will capture a big slice partly because its once-quarterly injection schedule for some patients is less demanding than the once-per-month injections common with Lucentis.“That’s where for patients and caregivers it often gets extremely overwhelming,” said Marie-France Tschudin, head of Novartis’s main drugs division, told Reuters. “This is where Beovu comes in.”Roche sells Lucentis in the United States, Novartis sells it elsewhere in the world.Novartis also cited studies showing Beovu to be as effective as Eylea in improving vision and better than the Bayer Regeneron-made competitor at controlling retinal fluid, a hallmark of AMD disease activity.(This story corrects global sales figure for Eylea to $6.4 billion, not $4.1 billion, in tenth paragraph)"
2019-11-05,Eylea powers Regeneron\'s third-quarter profit beat; shares rise,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N27L35J,"Drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O beat analysts' estimates for third-quarter profit on Tuesday, boosted by higher demand for its blockbuster eye drug, Eylea, and eczema therapy Dupixent. Shares of the company rose 6.8% to $332, adding over $2 billion to Regeneron’s market value after it said its board had authorized a $1 billion buyback of common stock.Sales of Eylea, which has brought in over a $1 billion in quarterly revenue for more than two years, surged despite Roche Holding AG ROG.S and Novartis AG's NOVN.S Lucentis, among others, snapping at its heels. Quarterly sales of Eylea rose 14% to $1.92 billion, ahead of analysts’ estimate of $1.61 billion, according to Refinitiv estimates. The drug treats age-related degeneration in eyes.The sales were helped by a shortage of rival Roche Holding's ROG.S Avastin, Regeneron commercial head Marion McCourt said on a conference call. “We are hearing that patients that started on Eylea because of these shortages do continue on Eylea therapy,” said McCourt.Analysts, however, fear the recent approval of Novartis’ anti-blindness drug Beovu could eat into sales of Eylea, adding to its troubles as it is expected to lose patents in the next five years.Regeneron also disclosed in a filing on Tuesday that it had received a civil investigative demand from the U.S. Department of Justice into incentives paid to doctors that could violate certain federal laws.The request for information relates to several of its drugs including Eylea and Dupixent, Regeneron said, adding that it was cooperating with the investigation.Meanwhile, Regeneron is expecting Dupixent, developed with Sanofi SASY.PA, to be its next growth driver and has massed up approvals for three major diseases including asthma and nasal polyps, since the drug was approved in 2017.Dupixent’s quarterly sales more than doubled to $633.1 million, beating expectations of $620.6 million.Separately, the company also reported interim data from a late-stage trial of its drug Libtayo in lung cancer patients.Guggenheim analyst Yatin Suneja said the rate of response for Libtayo seen in the trial was broadly in line with Merck & Co's MRK.N Keytruda, which dominates the market for first-line treatment of advanced lung cancer.The drug could be a potential threat to Keytruda if it continued to display similar responses, Suneja said in a client note.Excluding one-time items, Regeneron earned $6.67 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $6.36.Total revenue rose 23.1% to $2.05 billion."

JBPRE01Repatha and Praluent, which similar to inclisiran aim to inhibit PCSK9 proteins that lead to elevated levels of bad LDL cholesterol in people with heart disease, have struggled to gain traction due a demanding dosing regiment as well as objections to their price, which makers have been forced to slash to less than $6,000 annually.Narasimhan said he is confident that inclisiran can produce an attractive return on investment and contribute to sales starting in 2021, contingent upon regulatory approval and completion of the deal.“We see returns well in excess of cost of capital,” Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch said. Novartis plans to pay for with one-third cash and two-thirds long-term borrowings.Inclisiran could become one of its best-selling medicines, Basel-based Novartis predicted, adding the transaction had been approved by the boards of both companies.The acquisition would modestly dilute core earnings per share versus a no-deal scenario during the next few years, but should then be significantly accretive to group core operating income and core EPS in the medium term, Novartis said.Inclisiran, for use on top of statins by heart patients who struggle to lower their cholesterol levels with traditional therapy, is seen as complementing Novartis’s growing business with its heart-failure medicine Entresto, which topped the $1 billion annual revenue threshold last year.Narasimhan said the company can leverage the sales force it built up to help boost the initially slow Entresto sales to market inclisiran, too.Novartis has historically had a strong cardiovascular drug franchise, but lost ground when Diovan, once a $6 billion-per-year seller, lost patent protection in 2012. It left the company without an immediate, innovative follow-up product.The deal fits Narasimhan’s target of acquisitions of up to $10 billion to bolster the group’s portfolio of medicines with new products or technologies.Novartis’ hunt for deals comes as billions in revenue is under threat from upcoming patent expirations including on Lucentis, for macular degeneration, iron overload medicine Exjade and $3.3 billion-per-year MS drug Gilenya.Still, Novartis said it is confident that new products including inclisiran will help bolster growth and profitability.It expects to expand core operating income margins in its Innovative Medicines division to the “mid-thirties” in the near term and to the “mid-to high-thirties” in the medium term."

2019-12-09,"Sanofi ends research in diabetes, narrows units to spur profit",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1YD2BI,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi SA said on Monday it would end its research efforts in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases as part of a revamp that will narrow the number of its business units in the hope of bolstering growth and profit.The French drugmaker, whose pipeline has disappointed investors in recent years, poached new chief executive Paul Hudson from Swiss pharma group Novartis in September to revitalize the company.Its move to ditch diabetes research - announced alongside cost savings targets - marks a major turning point for a firm whose products dominated the insulin market for nearly two decades, before it was hit by patent losses and a drop in sales.“We recognize it is getting more difficult to get breakthrough innovation and that we have to be efficient and move our resources to areas of opportunity, as tough a choice as that is,” Hudson told reporters.The firm is bulking up elsewhere, as in the lucrative field of cancer drugs. It announced a deal to buy U.S. biotechnology firm Synthorx for about $2.5 billion earlier on Monday.Sanofi, which is due to further detail strategic plans to investors on Tuesday in Cambridge, Massachusetts, said it was targeting new cost savings of 2 billion euros ($2.20 billion) by 2022, by tightening spending and shaking up its supply chain.It also aims for a core operating margin of 30% by then, up from 25.8% last year.The group emphasized the potential for its eczema treatment Dupixent, recently approved in other therapeutic areas such as asthma, with an aim to expand sales to more than 10 billion euros.Revenue for the drug, developed with U.S. partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, was up 268% in 2018, reaching 788 million euros.Sanofi, currently organized around five global business units, said it would rejig these around three pillars: specialty care, which includes oncology and rare diseases, as well as vaccines and general medicines.Its consumer healthcare unit - known for over-the-counter products such as paracetamol Doliprane, erectile dysfunction drug Cialis and influenza treatment Tamiflu - will be considered as a standalone business, Sanofi said.It would have its own operational dynamic, the firm added, though it did not clarify what this meant in the longer term.Sources told Reuters last month that Sanofi was considering a joint venture or an outright sale among options for the division.“Our objective for the consumer healthcare business is to unlock value and entrepreneurial energy by growing faster than the market over mid-term,” Hudson said."
2019-12-10,"Sanofi shares rally on new margin goals, narrower drug focus",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N28K1Z8,"PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Sanofi SASY.PA rose on Tuesday after the French drugmaker said it would focus on vaccines and treatments like its promising eczema medicine Dupixent to grow sales, in a business revamp seen as potentially leading to spin-offs. Like rivals from Britain's GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L to Switzerland's Novartis NOVN.S, the company, which also announced cost savings targets and a goal to boost margins, is trying to zoom in on potential blockbuster drugs.Sanofi is gathering investors in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to discuss ways to improve performance. A research and development day is to take place in June next year.“We have to have a more competitive mind. We have extraordinary people but there is a lot of bureaucracy we need to get rid off and we have not done enough prioritization,” new Chief Executive Paul Hudson, poached from Novartis in September, said in opening remarks.Minutes before starting his address, Sanofi said it would simplify its antibody collaboration for two key drugs by restructuring a royalty-based agreement with its U.S partner Regeneron.Long a leader in the diabetes market with its prescription medication Lantus, Sanofi has struggled in recent years to keep pace in this field with new treatments, and revenues faltered as patents expired.It now wants to reverse this course, ending research in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases.Sanofi is investing in its more buoyant businesses like rare diseases and making a further push in the cancer market, snapping up U.S. biotechnology firm Synthorx THOR.O in a cash deal worth about $2.5 billion. At 1420 GMT, Sanofi shares were up 5.1% at 86.05 euros. Year-to-date, the stock is up about 18%, compared with a 25% rise for the European healthcare sector. .SXDP.Sanofi highlighted the potential for some new launches like Dupixent, an eczema treatment approved in other therapeutic areas such as asthma, which it said could reach over 10 billion euros ($11 billion) in sales from under 1 billion euros in 2018.“We are encouraged that Sanofi is prioritizing Dupixent,” analysts at Credit Suisse said in a note.Sanofi also announced a target to reach a core operating margin of 30% by 2022, up from 25.8% last year, and ahead of some analysts’ targets, including those at Jefferies.The group said it would carve out its consumer health business, home to over-the-counter products such as influenza treatment Tamiflu, as a standalone unit with its own operational dynamic, on top of three other main divisions.Hudson did not comment on what this meant for the unit further out, although Sanofi has been considering a joint venture or an outright sale among options for the consumer health business, sources have previously said.“The market is likely to take (that) as confirmation that the business will leave the group at some point in the future,” analysts at JPMorgan said."

2019-2-13,"Teva Pharm sees weaker than expected 2019, shares tumble",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1Q21HL,"TEL AVIV/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Teva Pharmaceutical Industries forecast lower revenue and profit for 2019 on Wednesday, missing analysts’ expectations, as it faces generic competition for two key branded drugs.Israel-based Teva, the world’s largest generic drugmaker, is counting on its new migraine drug Ajovy and Huntington’s treatment Austedo to help revive its fortunes after it was forced to restructure to tackle a debt crisis.Sales from its blockbuster multiple sclerosis drug Copaxone have been declining due to generic competition, which is also expected to hurt sales of respiratory drug ProAir this year.“We continue to expect that 2019 will be... a year in which we will experience similar challenges to those of 2018 including the continued erosion of Copaxone in the U.S. and Europe as well as the introduction of generics in the ProAir market,” Chief Executive Kare Schultz said. He sees a return to growth in 2020.Teva shares were down 7.9 percent to $17.62 in New York.For 2019 Teva forecast adjusted earnings per share of $2.20-$2.50 and revenue of $17.0-$17.4 billion. Analysts were forecasting EPS of $2.81 on revenue of $17.9 billion.Sales of Ajovy, which won approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in September, were $3 million in 2018 but are expected to grow to $150 million this year.Last month, CVS Health Corp, a top U.S. manager of pharmacy benefits, added Ajovy and a competing drug from Eli Lilly to its list of covered drugs, although it has been excluded from preferred coverage by two other large payers.Teva said payer access was fluid and some decisions will likely be changed later this year.Teva’s drug has access to nearly two-thirds of payers and Schultz said he was content with this level.Another long-anticipated product has been Teva’s generic version of Mylan NV’s EpiPen, which despite approval in August has been in short supply.“In a product like this you should over a couple of years shoot for ending up somewhere close to 50 percent” of the market, the Danish-born CEO said.Teva is also banking on other biologic drugs - which are more expensive than chemical-based drugs to develop - to boost revenues in future and has high hopes for a non-addictive pain treatment it is developing with Regeneron.It expects to maintain research and development spending at around 6 percent of revenue.Teva earned 53 cents per share excluding one-time items in the fourth quarter of 2018, down from 93 cents a year earlier. Revenue fell 16 percent to $4.6 billion.Analysts had forecast Teva would earn 54 cents a share ex-items on revenue of $4.5 billion, according to I/B/E/S data from Refinitiv.North American sales of Copaxone tumbled 44 percent in the quarter to $356 million while generic product sales in North America fell 10 percent.Global sales of Copaxone are forecast to tumble to $1.5 billion this year from $2.4 billion in 2018.ProAir sales reached $397 million in 2018 but Teva sees significant erosion in 2019 due to generic competition."

2019-3-11,Regeneron\\/Sanofi wins U.S. approval for expanded use of skin drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1QS2GS,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said it approved expanded use of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA’s eczema drug Dupixent to include patients aged between 12 and 17, a boost for both the companies in the world’s largest market for drugs.Shares of Regeneron closed up 2.3 percent at $412.05 on Monday.The FDA first approved the drug in 2017 and it has since been launched as a treatment for adults with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, or eczema, as well as a drug for some asthma patients.The companies estimate that there are about 300,000-400,000 adults in the United States who are most in need of treatment, and that the number of adolescent patients is about half of this population.The new approval allows Dupixent to be prescribed to adolescent patients whose atopic dermatitis cannot be adequately managed with topical prescription medicines, or when such therapies are not advisable, Regeneron said in a statement.The biologic therapy, delivered as a shot, targets two key proteins that may play a central role in the inflammation underlying certain allergic diseases.The drug represents an important growth driver for both the companies which are testing its use in patients with conditions like eosinophilic esophagitis as well as food and environmental allergies.In recent years, Regeneron’s investors have been focusing on newer drugs such as Dupixent, as the company’s flagship drug, Eylea, faces increased competition.Sanofi has been placing hopes on continued upswing for the drug as it faces weakness in its diabetes business due to generic rivals.The drug, which brought in $922 million in revenue for Sanofi in 2018, gained a U.S. FDA nod last year for use as a maintenance therapy in patients with two forms of asthma.Piper Jaffray analysts, before the approval, said they expected U.S. sales of $661 million in 2021 from Dupixent’s use in treating adolescents alone."
2019-3-18,Amarin\'s Vascepa cuts occurrence of serious heart problems 30 percent: study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1QZ1I4,"(Reuters) - A high dose of Amarin Corp’s Omega-3 drug Vascepa significantly reduced the occurrence of first and subsequent heart attacks, strokes and other serious heart problems in high-risk patients already taking cholesterol medication by even more than initially reported, according to data presented on Monday.Compared with a placebo, Vascepa cut the combined rate of heart attacks, strokes, heart-related death, need for artery-clearing procedures and hospitalizations for unstable angina by 30 percent in heart disease patients at high risk for such events.Amarin in September released initial results from the study of 8,179 patients already taking other heart drugs that showed a 25 percent reduction of serious heart events for those receiving a 4 gram dose of Vascepa compared with placebo, data that sent its share price surging from around $3 to over $12.“With this drug, we are not only preventing that first heart attack but potentially the second stroke and maybe that third fatal event,” Deepak Bhatt, the study’s lead investigator from Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said in a statement.“Prevention of such subsequent cardiovascular events could improve patient outcomes and quality of life and may lower the total cost burden of medical care,” Bhatt added.The data was presented at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting in New Orleans.Vascepa, a highly purified omega-3 fatty acid, a fat found in fish oil, originally won U.S. approval to treat patients with very high levels of triglycerides in their blood. Patients with high triglycerides who also have complications like diabetes are especially vulnerable to recurring cardiovascular complications.Approval of an updated label for the pill that includes the heart protection data should significantly boost sales, and potentially pit Vascepa against the more expensive injectable cholesterol drugs Repatha from Amgen and Praluent from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi.Analysts are forecasting 2019 Vascepa sales of more than $350 million and climbing to $1 billion by 2023, according to Refinitiv data.A breakdown of the updated data shows Vascepa cut the rate of first heart events by 25 percent and second events by 32 percent. The incidence of a fourth or more events was reduced by 48 percent versus placebo.In addition to statins to lower cholesterol, such as Pfizer’s Lipitor, most of the patients in the study were also talking other heart drugs, such as blood pressure medicines or blood clot preventers."

2019-4-08,Regeneron forays into gene-silencing therapies with Alnylam tie-up,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N21Q2QF,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said it would invest $800 million in Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc to develop treatments for eye and central nervous system diseases using gene-silencing RNA interference (RNAi) technology.Alnylam, which last year won U.S. approval for the first treatment using the Nobel prize-winning technology, has a host of other such therapies in its pipeline for various genetic, cardio-metabolic, liver and eye and central nervous system (CNS) diseases.RNAi works by targeting and “silencing” specific genetic material, blocking the production of deadly proteins that cause diseases.Regeneron will make a $400 million upfront payment to Alnylam and also purchase 4.44 million of Alnylam common shares at $90 per share. The investment represents about 4 percent stake in Alnylam, according to data from Refinitiv.Alnylam’s shares fell 0.8 percent to $92.03 in mid-morning trade, while Regeneron was down nearly 3 percent at $397.22.“The alliance structure enables Alnylam to continue to build its industry-leading pipeline of RNAi therapeutics while retaining significant product rights,” Alnylam Chief Executive Officer John Maraganore said in a statement.Regeneron, the maker of top-selling eye drug, Eylea, will lead development and commercialization for all programs targeting eye diseases.“(The deal) is important as Regeneron lacks a deep pipeline and Eylea is facing tangible threats,” Cowen and Co analyst Yaron Werber said.SVB Leerink’s Geoffrey Porges expects Regeneron investors to be cautious about the deal until the first one or two drug candidates are announced and reach the clinic, given the hefty upfront payment.For central nervous system programs, both companies will have the option of selecting drug candidates to participate equally in potential future profits of programs led by the other party.Guggenheim analyst Whitney Ijem said the monetization of the CNS platform was a positive for Alnylam and provides further validation of its platform.The collaboration also includes a select number of RNAi therapeutic programs designed to target genes expressed in the liver, which can influence a wide variety of diseases throughout the body, the companies said.“This deal could be a source of long-term growth for both companies. This gives Regeneron the option to have RNAi technology and Alnylam a strong partner that can help them identify new targets,” Jefferies analyst Maury Raycroft told Reuters.Alnylam is eligible to receive up to an additional $200 million in milestone payments upon achievement of certain criteria during early clinical development for the programs.Separately, Alnylam said it concluded its five-year gene-silencing drug research and option agreement with Sanofi SA."

2019-6-04,Sanofi loses German patent case against Amgen over cholesterol drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N23B1RV,"KARLSRUHE, Germany (Reuters) - Germany’s highest civil court on Tuesday rejected French drugmaker Sanofi’s bid to fend off a legal challenge by U.S. rival Amgen against Sanofi’s cholesterol drug Praluent.In the latest setback for Sanofi in the drawn-out patent dispute with Amgen, which is selling its rival drug Repatha, the German court ruled that Sanofi was not entitled to a special license that would have protected its Praluent business.Officials at Sanofi did not have an immediate comment.Amgen had initially sued Sanofi in Germany as part of a legal campaign in various jurisdictions, claiming the French group had violated its patent on Repatha.Both drugs belong to a class of PCSK9 inhibitors, used against persistently high cholesterol levels in the blood, and aimed at the millions of people who don’t benefit from statins such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor.With Amgen’s challenge ongoing, Sanofi opened a new legal front and petitioned the German patent court to be granted a license to use Amgen’s patent to secure Praluent’s continued market presence in Germany, Europe’s largest drug market.After its bid was rejected by the patent court in September, Sanofi turned to the higher court but the case was turned down again on Tuesday.Praluent will, however, remain on the German market as long as Amgen’s legal challenge against the drug’s patent continues.A U.S. jury in February confirmed the validity of Amgen’s patents on Repatha, rejecting a challenge by Sanofi and its partner Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in the protracted dispute."

2019-6-17,Genetics research gets help from social media,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1TI2IX,"(Reuters Health) - Researchers have harnessed the power of social media to build a genetic database, according to a new report.The “Genes for Good” project, which turned to Facebook to recruit people to fill out surveys and send in saliva samples for DNA analysis, has thus far collected data from more than 27,000 volunteers.Participants come from all 50 states and from diverse ancestral backgrounds, the researchers write in The American Journal of Human Genetics.“The data we get matches what’s come from traditional studies,” said study coauthor, Goncalo Abecasis, a professor at the University of Michigan School of Public Health and vice president for analytical genetics and data sciences at Regeneron Pharmaceuticals. “And we’ve been able to do a few things that are hard to do with data collected in the traditional way, such as track people over time.”The researchers are hoping to discover the functions of various genes through the new database. “It would be nice to be able to figure out the functions of genes in humans rather than in mice,” Abecasis said.Back in 2015, Abecasis and his colleagues started to wonder whether the popularity of Facebook could be harnessed to develop a database for genetic studies. They built a Facebook page and started taking members. Currently, the Genes for Good project has sent out “spit kits” to more than 32,000 individuals. There is no charge for the kits and their genetic analysis, and participants get information back including a breakdown of their genetic ancestry.To get a sense of whether the demographics of their volunteers were a good representation of the U.S. population, the Abecasis and his colleagues compared the volunteers’ disease rates to those found in government statistics for the nation as a whole. It turns out that the Genes for Good volunteers had similar disease rates to the rest of the country, although as a group, they are a bit on the younger side. The volunteers also had widely varying ancestry and were diverse geographically and economically. Most of them were from the middle-income bracket with household incomes ranging from $35,000 to $100,000.Thus far, the team has gotten more than 27,000 kits back out of the more than 32,000 they sent out. Since their method of recruiting volunteers is nontraditional, the researchers decided to compare the demographics of their database to preexisting ones. Previous studies using other databases have identified genetic variants linked to physical traits, such as eye color and skin tone, and to health conditions, such as asthma. The data from Genes for Good largely matched those results.The researchers have currently paused their data collection while they look for more funding.Genes for Good seems to have “tapped into the public’s interest in things that are free and ancestry related,” said Dr. Joann Bodurtha, a professor of pediatrics and oncology at the McKusick-Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine at Johns Hopkins Medicine. “The biggest new twist in their project is in some of their tracking data.”The project does have some limitations, Bodurtha said. First, it’s completely dependent on people’s self-reports, she said. These days researchers are finding more accurate ways of following people’s habits and behaviors, such as using Fitbits to determine how much exercise study volunteers are getting, Bodurtha said.Another issue, Bodurtha said, is the small percentage of African Americans in the database.SOURCE: bit.ly/2x14yx4 American Journal of Human Genetics, online June 13, 2019."

2019-6-26,FDA approves expanded label for Regeneron\\/Sanofi\'s Dupixent,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN1TR2RU,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Wednesday approved Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA’s drug Dupixent to treat nasal polyps, marking the third major use for the injectable medicine.The expanded label, which could significantly boost annual sales, is for use with other medicines to treat patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, the companies said in a joint statement.The FDA first approved Dupixent in 2017 for moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis, or eczema, and in 2018 it won U.S. approval to treat moderate-to-severe asthma as well.Chronic rhinosinusitis is a persistent inflammation of the mucous membranes in the nose and sinuses that can lead to development of nasal polyps - teardrop shaped, noncancerous growths that can cause irritation and swelling.The companies believe Dupixent will be able to treat between 55,000 and 90,000 adults with the condition in the United States, who have not been able to control their disease despite having used oral corticosteroids or having undergone sinus surgery.Cowen analyst Yaron Werber, citing the drug’s effectiveness and clean safety profile, forecast that the additional approval will add $956.3 million to Dupixent’s worldwide sales in 2024, calling it “a sizable but overlooked market with few entrenched competitors.”The companies will also have first mover advantage over other biologics, he added.Data released earlier this month showed Roche AG and Novartis’ Xolair is able to treat patients with chronic rhinosinusitis with nasal polyps, potentially pitting it against Dupixent in this patient group.However, it is unlikely the drug will enter market before the end of next year, Werber said.Sanofi recorded Dupixent sales of 788 million euros ($896.43 million) in 2018. Analysts are expecting sales of about $1.86 billion this year, according to Refinitiv data.Dupixent is an important growth driver for both Sanofi and Regeneron, whose flagship eye drug Eylea faces increased competition.The companies are also testing it for eosinophilic esophagitis, an allergic inflammatory disease of the esophagus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and for food and environmental allergies.“It is really turning out to be quite an unusual drug in the breadth of activity that we are seeing,” David Weinreich, head of Global Clinical Development at Regeneron said."

Dupixent was initially prescribed for atopic dermatitis and later approved for asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis.Sales of Dupixent, developed with U.S firm Regeneron REGN.O, rose 168% at constant exchange rates in the second quarter to 496 million euros ($551.80 million).So far, the medicine has been made available in 28 countries and 18 launches are to take place by year-end.Sanofi hopes Dupixent’s strong sales prospects and other drugs at its rare diseases business Genzyme, along with those of vaccines and other upcoming products, will continue to offset weakness of the group’s diabetes unit.Diabetes sales in the second quarter were down 7%, hit again by pricing pressure on its patent-expired Lantus insulin.Second-quarter net income rose 4.9% at constant exchange rates to 1.64 billion euros while sales were up 3.9% to 8.63 billion euros.Sanofi booked an 1.8 billion euros impairment charge in the quarter related to hemophilia product Eloctate, after lower sales in the U.S. and a revision of sales projections.Eloctate's revenue fell 11%, a result of direct competition from Roche's ROGN.S Hemlibra, a newcomer in the market.“It is a non-cash event of course but it is clear that the competition from Hemlibra was a surprise to everyone and it is indeed putting pressure,” Sanofi chief financial officer Jean-Baptiste de Chatillon told reporters.Eloctate was developed by U.S. hemophilia specialist Bioverativ, which Sanofi bought last year for $11.6 billion.($1 = 0.8988 euros)"

The drug, injected into the eye to treat age-related macular degeneration and other diseases, is a major growth driver for Regeneron, and showed no sign of stopping in the quarter despite competition from Roche Holding AG ROG.S and Novartis AG's NOVN.S Lucentis.U.S. sales of Eylea jumped 17% to $1.16 billion in the latest quarter, topping expectations of about $1.10 billion, according to consensus estimates compiled by brokerage Credit Suisse.However, Eylea could face possible patent losses in the next five years and analysts expect sales to be further threatened next year by broluciuzmab, an experimental drug developed by Novartis.Investors have also been cautious as the drug pricing debate rages on in the United States and they digest ambitious proposals from the government as well as from Democratic presidential candidates.Among the many proposals aimed at lowering costs is a plan to create an “international pricing index” that would link the price Medicare pays for drugs to the lower prices paid overseas.“These results represent a clear positive, albeit against the backdrop of drug pricing and broluciuzmab overhangs that will likely persist for the near-term,” UBS Securities analyst Carter Gould wrote in a client note.The quarter was also helped by sales of Dupixent, developed in partnership with Sanofi SA SASY.PA. The companies have massed up approvals for three major diseases for their drug Dupixent including asthma and nasal polyps since the drug was approved in 2017.Dupixent’s quarterly sales, recorded by Sanofi, rose 166.3% to $557.3 million, handily beating analysts’ consensus of $454 million.Revenue from the company’s tie-up with Sanofi of $349.1 million also came in ahead of consensus estimates of $306 million.Regeneron’s total revenue rose 20.3% to $1.93 billion in the second quarter ended June 30, beating the average analyst estimate of $1.80 billion, according to IBES data from Refinitiv.Excluding one-time items, the company earned $6.02 per share, above the average analyst estimate of $5.41."

In comparison, 29% of the patients on REGN-EB3 and 34% on mAb114 died.Jean-Jacques Muyembe, director general of Congo’s Institut National de Recherche Biomédicale in DRC, who co-led the trial, said the results meant that “from now on, we will no longer say that Ebola is incurable.”“These advances will help save thousands of lives,” he told reporters.Anthony Fauci, NIAID’s director, also said the results were “very good news” for the fight against Ebola.The agency said that of the patients who were brought into treatment centers with low levels of virus detected in their blood, 94% who got REGN-EB3 and 89% on mAb114 survived.In comparison, two-thirds of the patients who got Remdesivir and nearly three-quarters on ZMapp survived.Ebola has been spreading in eastern Congo since August 2018 in an outbreak that has now killed at least 1,800 people. Efforts to control it have been hampered by militia violence and some local resistance to outside help.A vast Ebola outbreak in West Africa from 2013 to 2016 became the world’s largest ever when it spread through Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone and killed more than 11,300 people.The Congo treatment trial, which began in November last year, is being carried out by an international research group coordinated by the World Health Organization (WHO).Mike Ryan, head of the WHO’s emergencies program, said the trial’s positive findings were encouraging but would not be enough on their own to bring the epidemic to an end.“The news today is fantastic. It gives us a new tool in our toolbox against Ebola, but it will not in itself stop Ebola,” he told reporters.Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust global health charity, also hailed the success of the trial’s findings, saying they would “undoubtedly save lives”.“The more we learn about these two treatments ... the closer we can get to turning Ebola from a terrifying disease to one that is preventable and treatable,” he said in a statement.“We won’t ever get rid of Ebola but we should be able to stop these outbreaks from turning into major national and regional epidemics.”Some 681 patients at four separate treatment centers in Congo have already been enrolled in the Congo treatment clinical trial, Fauci said. The study aims to enroll a total of 725.The decision to drop two of the trial drugs was based on data from almost 500 patients, he said, which showed that those who got REGN-EB3 or mAb114 “had a greater chance of survival compared to those participants in the other two arms”.The two promising drugs are made from Ebola antibodies - a protein produced by the immune system to defend against infection. Regeneron’s product is a cocktail of three Ebola antibodies, while mAb114 is a single antibody developed by scientists at NIAID."

2019-8-28,"U.S. judge rules for Regeneron, Sanofi in Amgen cholesterol drug patent fight",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N25O1DP,"(Reuters) - A U.S. judge on Wednesday set aside a jury verdict that found Amgen Inc patents on its cholesterol drug Repatha were valid, handing a victory to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA, which sells a rival drug.The ruling from U.S. District Judge Richard Andrews in Wilmington, Delaware was the latest reversal of fortune in a long-running lawsuit in which Amgen is seeking to stop French drugmaker Sanofi and U.S. biotech Regeneron from selling their drug Praluent.Repatha and Praluent won U.S. approval about two weeks apart in July of 2016. Both drugs dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol by blocking a protein known as PCSK9 that prevents LDL removal from the blood. The injected drugs were later shown to also cut the risk of heart attacks.The judge, in setting aside the jury’s verdict reached in February, said some patent claims by Amgen relating to antibodies targeting PCSK9 were invalid because they did not sufficiently disclose the Thousand Oaks, California-based company’s claimed innovations.“It has been our longstanding belief that all of Amgen’s asserted U.S. PCSK9 patent claims are invalid, and we are pleased that today’s decision reaffirms this,” Sanofi and Regeneron said in a statement.California-based Amgen said in a statement that it disagreed with aspects of the court’s decision and will seek review by the appellate court.“Protecting intellectual property is critical to our business since it allows for our investment in the research and development of new medicines,” Amgen said. “Consequently, we are disappointed with today’s decision, and we look forward to presenting our case to uphold the jury’s verdict.”Despite initial forecasts for multibillion-dollar sales, restrictions placed by insurers on use of the potent but expensive drugs have severely limited patient access and sales.Repatha had worldwide sales of $152 million in the second quarter of 2019, while Regeneron reported Praluent sales of $73.7 million for the period."
2019-9-19,Factbox: Animal health sector aims to emulate Zoetis biotech leap,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1W4155,"(Reuters) - A commercial breakthrough in the field of complex therapeutic proteins for dogs by sector leader Zoetis ZTS.N has roused rivals to action in a hunt for biotechnology medicines to treat pets. Previously reserved for humans, biotech drugs made from genetically engineered living cells are now seen as ripe for the pet health market. The following are some of the recent deals, launches and development projects in the space:- British animal health company Dechra Pharmaceuticals Inc DPH.L agreed to a deal www.akstonbio.com in August to utilize development work by U.S. insulin specialist Akston Biosciences for a once weekly shot for diabetic dogs to replace daily injections, with a view to expanding the collaboration to cats. Dechra has said long-acting insulin, which is typically produced from genetically modified bacteria, should become its biggest product.- U.S. animal health company Kindred Biosciences Inc KIN.O, which repurposed a human antidepressant to stimulate appetite in underweight cats, has several genetically engineered biologic drugs under development kindredbio.com/pipeline, targeting diseases such as dermatitis in dogs and anemia in cats.- German early-stage biotech research firm Adivo in April signed a global collaboration deal here with Bayer's BAYGn.DE animal health unit a little over a year after Adivo was spun out of human biotech firm Morphosys MORG.DE with a mission to develop antibodies for dogs. - Privately-held German drugmaker Boehringer Ingelheim, the global No. 2 in animal health, in April launched here the first stem cell-based veterinary medicine to treat lameness in horses caused by inflamed joints, a common worry for both recreational and competitive riders.- Industry leader Zoetis Inc ZTS.N, which has a successful anti-itch biotech drug for dogs on the market, said here in August it was seeking approval for more antibodies, targeting osteoarthritic pain in cats with plans for a 2021 market launch, drawing on its 2017 acquisition of Nexvet Biopharma. A similar product for dogs is also in the pipeline.- In June of 2018, Zoetis signed a deal here with human biotech firm Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O to adopt its antibody technology for animals, targeting inflammatory disease and cancer."

2020-1-09,Regeneron\'s bone disorder drug reduces lesions in mid-stage study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N29E2S5,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Thursday its experimental treatment for a very rare genetic bone disorder showed a nearly 90% reduction in new lesions compared to placebo, in a mid-stage study.The drugmaker said it plans to use detailed results from the trial as the basis of regulatory submissions and that it would also conduct a study in children with FOP.The drug, garetosmab, tested in patients with fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), reduces the formation of bone lesions by neutralizing a protein called Activin A.The protein is critical to heterotopic ossification, a process where the muscles, tendons and ligaments of FOP patients are progressively replaced by bone.FOP leads to abnormal bone formation resulting in skeletal deformities, progressive loss of mobility and premature death, and has no approved treatments, the drugmaker said.There are only about 800 patients diagnosed with the disorder worldwide and most of them are wheelchair bound by the age of 30, the company said. FOP patients, on average, live as long as 56 years."
2020-1-10,Eli Lilly to add eczema drug with $1.1 billion deal for Dermira,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1Z917Z,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N said on Friday it would buy skin disease specialist Dermira Inc DERM.O for about $1.1 billion in cash, bolstering its arsenal with an experimental therapy for skin condition atopic dermatitis.Lilly will pay $18.75 per Dermira share, or a 2.2% premium to Dermira’s last closing price. It said the price represented a premium of about 86% to Dermira’s 60-day volume-weighted average trading price including Friday’s closing price.Dermira shares, which have doubled in the last one month, rose 5.1% to $19.28, rising over the offer price.The share movement has some investors questioning if another bidder might step up for Dermira, Cantor Fitzgerald analyst Louise Chen said.Chen said Pfizer Inc PFE.N could be interested in atopic dermatitis treatments, but noted that it was already testing a drug for the condition which causes red and itchy skin. With the acquisition, Lilly gets Dermira’s experimental treatment for atopic dermatitis, a common form of eczema, which is in late-stage testing, as well as an approved medicated cloth for excessive armpit sweating.Dermira gained some rights to the eczema drug, lebrikizumab, in 2017 from Roche AG ROG.S, and last year signed a deal with Almirall SA ALM.MC for an option to license European rights to the drug.If approved, lebrikizumab would compete with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O and Sanofi SA's SASY.PA Dupixent, with some analysts forecasting peak sales upwards of $600 million in 2027. The drug, which belongs to a class of treatments known as monoclonal antibodies, would add to Lilly’s immunology treatments, including the psoriasis treatment Taltz.Last year Eli Lilly paid out a hefty sum of $8 billion for Loxo Oncology Inc for its pipeline of cancer drugs that target rare genetic mutations.Lilly has been focused on increasing sales in core franchises such as cancer, as sales of its older blockbuster medicines such as diabetes treatment Humalog face pressure from generic competition.“The acquisition of Dermira is consistent with Lilly’s strategy to augment our own internal research by acquiring clinical phase assets,” said Patrik Jonsson, president of Lilly Bio-Medicines.Lilly is also testing another drug, Olumiant or baricitinib, as a treatment for atopic dermatitis.Evercore was the exclusive financial adviser for Lilly, while Dermira’s financial advisers were SVB Leerink and Citi, the lead adviser."

2020-1-13,Novartis to speed access to $10 billion heart drug via NHS deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ZC1ZR,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis and Britain’s National Health Service (NHS) on Monday announced a pact that will clear the way for accelerated review by the country’s health watchdog NICE for heart drug inclisiran, which could make it broadly available as soon as 2021.Novartis hopes the NHS deal will boost sales of cholesterol-lowering inclisiran, which the Swiss drugmaker bought in a deal announced last year for nearly $10 billion and predicts will be a top seller.Inclisiran was submitted to U.S. regulators last year, and Novartis expects a European submission in coming weeks.The pact also calls for a UK clinical trial, based on proprietary NHS data, to identify patients at risk of heart disease for whom conventional treatment has not worked, as well as a collaboration on manufacture of cutting-edge drugs like inclisiran, which targets “bad cholesterol”, a culprit behind heart attacks and strokes.Heart disease or hardening of the arteries is a big killer in Britain and the NHS has made fighting cardiovascular disorders one of its long-term priorities.“If licensed, it will allow the drug to be put through the NICE approval process at the earliest opportunity possible, making it available to NHS patients much earlier,” Britain’s Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said, in response to Reuters questions.Should inclisiran win U.K. approval, as expected, the deal calls for the NHS to pay for it as an add-on therapy for those patients whose cholesterol levels do not respond adequately to statins, at a significantly reduced price.The DHSC did not release the agreed price, citing commercial confidentiality. It also declined to comment on whether Novartis would be required to make inclisiran in Britain.British health minister Matt Hancock said: “This collaboration has the potential to save 30,000 lives over the next ten years.”Novartis bought inclisiran with its $9.7 billion acquisition of The Medicines Co., announced in late November, to expand a cardiovascular medicines portfolio that already includes heart failure drug Entresto, a billion-dollar-per-year seller.Novartis Chief Executive Vas Narasimhan has predicted inclisiran will become one of Novartis’s most-lucrative medicines but has warned of “a few years of slow ramp” before sales take off.Narasimhan has said inclisiran’s price tag would be in the “cost-effective range” to compete with rival medicines, Amgen’s Repatha and Praluent from Regeneron and Sanofi.They list at some $5,800 annually in the United States, following price cuts undertaken to boost slumping sales.

He wore a mask and business suit and did not speak to reporters.“I think I’m doing very well, but we’re going to make sure that things work out,” Trump said in a brief video posted to Twitter.Trump will work in a special hospital suite for the next few days as a precautionary measure, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. Online video showed a small group of Trump supporters outside Walter Reed on Friday evening waving Trump 2020 flags, most not wearing masks.Trump, 74, has a mild fever, according to a source familiar with the matter. White House doctor Sean P. Conley said he is being treated with an experimental drug cocktail and is “fatigued but in good spirits.”It was the latest setback for the Republican president, who is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.Trump, who has played down the threat of the coronavirus pandemic from the outset, wrote on Twitter earlier on Friday that he and his wife Melania were going into quarantine after testing positive for the virus, which has killed more than 200,000 Americans and severely damaged the U.S. economy.A number of other prominent Republicans also tested positive on Friday, including former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and Republican senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis.Vice President Mike Pence, who would take over presidential duties if Trump became severely ill, tested negative, a spokesman said.

It’s about doing your part.”The Republican National Committee would choose a replacement nominee if Trump were to become incapacitated, but it is already too late in most states to change the names on the ballot. Some 2.9 million people have already voted, according to figures compiled by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald.Pence took over Trump’s planned calls with governors and retirees’ organizations. His Oct. 7 debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris will go forward as planned, organizers said.Harris has also tested negative for the virus, according to the campaign.The virus could also complicate Trump’s push to install conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.In addition to the president and his wife, at least four people who were at a White House event to announce Barrett’s nomination - Conway, Lee, Tillis and University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins - said Friday they have tested positive.Lee and Tillis are both members of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to begin hearings on Barrett’s nomination on Oct. 12.Barrett herself tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, according to a person familiar with the matter.Tillis, who said in a statement that he has no symptoms, will isolate at home for 10 days. Polls show a close race between him and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham for his North Carolina seat, one of several Democrats hope to flip in their quest to win a Senate majority in November.Conway, who left the White House at the end of August, said on Twitter she had a light cough but felt fine after testing positive.Three journalists also tested positive on Friday after spending time over the weekend at the White House or traveling with Trump, according to Zeke Miller, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association.Trump is the latest world leader to contract the virus, which can cause a severe respiratory infection.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was rushed into intensive care after falling gravely ill in March. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called the virus a “little flu” after being infected in July. Both men recovered."

His Oct. 7 debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris will go forward as planned, organizers said.Harris has also tested negative for the virus, according to the campaign.The virus could also complicate Trump’s push to install conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.In addition to the president and his wife, at least four people who were at a White House event to announce Barrett’s nomination - Conway, Lee, Tillis and University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins - said Friday they have tested positive.Lee and Tillis are both members of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to begin hearings on Barrett’s nomination on Oct. 12.Barrett herself tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, according to a person familiar with the matter.Tillis, who said in a statement that he has no symptoms, will isolate at home for 10 days. Polls show a close race between him and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham for his North Carolina seat, one of several Democrats hope to flip in their quest to win a Senate majority in November.Conway, who left the White House at the end of August, said on Twitter she had a light cough but felt fine after testing positive.Three journalists also tested positive on Friday after spending time over the weekend at the White House or traveling with Trump, according to Zeke Miller, president of the White House Correspondents’ Association.Trump is the latest world leader to contract the virus, which can cause a severe respiratory infection.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was rushed into intensive care after falling gravely ill in March. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called the virus a “little flu” after being infected in July. Both men recovered."
2020-10-02,Trump treated with experimental antibody cocktail for COVID-19,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26N3CL,"(Reuters) - President Donald Trump has been treated with an experimental antibody cocktail for COVID-19 and is moving to a military hospital as a precautionary measure, White House officials said on Friday.The president’s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, said in a statement that Trump “remains fatigued but in good spirits” after receiving an intravenous dose of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s dual antibody. Trump was also taking immune system boosters zinc and vitamin D, aspirin, and other generic drugs.Trump, 74, walked to a helicopter on Friday before being moved to a special suite at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for the next few days.Regeneron’s drug, REGN-COV2, is part of a class of experimental COVID-19 drugs known as monoclonal antibodies: manufactured copies of human antibodies to the virus that are being studied for use in patients with early illness.Trump’s doctors “must be sufficiently concerned with what they are seeing that they decided to use an experimental medicine ... Experimental drugs are by definition risky,” said Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez, infectious disease specialist at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.Antibodies are proteins made by the body’s immune system that latch onto and neutralize an invading virus. Regeneron’s cocktail - which contains an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that its two antibodies bind to the coronavirus’ spike protein, limiting the ability of viruses to escape.“The trouble is we don’t have good treatments for people with mild COVID-19 ... I imagine that they are doing this because they hope this is relatively low risk,” said Dr. Rajesh Gandhi, an infectious disease physician at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston.Data so far is limited for COVID-19 antibodies, but U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci is among those saying the technology has promise.Regeneron this week reported trial results showing that its drug improved symptoms in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with no serious side effects, and said it planned to talk with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) about an emergency use authorization.Eli Lilly & Co has also announced encouraging early data from a trial of its coronavirus antibody, and said it is seeking emergency authorization from the FDA.Shares of Regeneron rose about 3% in after hours trade, following the announcement that Trump was given the drug.Trump is also taking the heartburn drug famotidine - often sold in the U.S. under the brand name Pepcid. Although the drug has not been shown to work against COVID-19, researchers are studying it as a possible treatment.Zinc and vitamin D are believed to boost the immune system. Melatonin is a hormone that helps to regulate daily body rhythms. Trump has said in the past that he takes a daily low-dose aspirin, which is recommended for some adults at increased risk of heart attack or stroke."

2020-10-02,EXPLAINER-What is the treatment plan for President Trump\'s COVID-19?,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2GT25B,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said he and his wife Melania had tested positive for COVID-19, and the White House said he was given an experimental treatment designed to combat the virus as well as a small array of treatments including aspirin and Vitamin D.Trump, 74, has a slight fever, a source said, and is being taken to Walter Reed military hospital for several days as a precaution. Trump’s gender, age and weight make him more vulnerable to developing severe COVID-19, and give him a notional risk of around 4% of dying from it, health experts said.One of the most anticipated classes of experimental COVID-19 drugs is monoclonal antibodies: manufactured copies of human antibodies to the virus. The injected antibodies are designed to begin fighting the virus immediately and are being developed to prevent and treat COVID-19.The technique is already in wide use for treating a range of illnesses. Data so far is limited for COVID-19 antibodies, but U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci is among those saying it has promise.Trump is taking an antibody cocktail being tested by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which has reported improved symptoms in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, with no serious side effects in trials.WHAT ARE THE APPROVED TREATMENTS FOR ‘MILD’ COVID-19?“There are no treatments to date that have been really established to be effective in this phase of illness. At this point, it is really symptomatic and supportive care,” Dr. Jonathan Grein, director of hospital epidemiology at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, who is not involved in treating Trump, said in a telephone interview.Trump’s doctor said the president is taking several medicines, including:* Vitamin D and mineral zinc, both of which are important to the immune system and taken by some as immune system boosters.* heartburn drug famotidine, often sold under the brand name Pepcid. The drug has not been proven to work against COVID-19, but researchers are studying it as a potential treatment.* melatonin, often taken as a sleep aid.* aspirin, which Trump previously has said he takes daily. Aspirin can help avoid heart attacks and is a fever reducer.Grein said the president is likely being closely monitored, and would be given extra oxygen or fluids if needed. Supportive care would depend on symptoms: things such as cough syrup or fever-reducing drugs.Trump early in the pandemic backed the idea of using anti-malaria drug hydroxychloroquine to treat COVID-19. In May, the president said he was taking the drug to prevent an infection. The FDA briefly allowed use before in June withdrawing an emergency use authorization, saying it had determined hydroxychloroquine was not effective.Trump was moved to hospital in case his condition deteriorates - if, for instance, he developed breathing problems. “It is not uncommon for patients to have symptoms for several weeks. Some can get worse well into the second week of illness,” Dr. Grein said.For patients hospitalized with COVID-19, the FDA has given emergency-use authorization for two treatments: Veklury, also known as remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug sold by Gilead Sciences Inc, which has been shown to shorten hospital stays, and convalescent plasma, which is derived from the blood of people who have survived the disease and carries antibodies that can help a patient fight COVID-19.Hospitals also commonly use the generic steroid dexamethasone, which was shown in studies to improve survival for patients hospitalized with critical COVID-19 who need extra oxygen. But the steroid should not used in people with mild illness since it can limit the body’s own ability to combat the virus, according to guidelines from the Infectious Disease Society of America."

2020-10-03,"UPDATE 11-After mixed messages from White House, Trump says \'real test\' ahead in his COVID fight",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2GU03B,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said from his hospital room on Saturday that he felt “much better” but the next few days will be “the real test” of his treatment for COVID-19, capping a day of contradictory messages from the White House about his condition.In a four-minute video posted on Twitter, Trump, looking tired and wearing a jacket and open-necked shirt, said he “wasn’t feeling so well” when he first arrived at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday.“Over the next period of a few days, I guess that’s the real test, so we’ll be seeing what happens over those next couple of days,” Trump said, seated at a round table in front of an American flag.The remarks came hours after differing assessments of his health from administration officials left it unclear how ill the president had become since he tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday night, a matter of enormous public concern.A White House team of doctors said on Saturday morning that Trump’s condition was improving and that he was already talking about returning to the White House. One doctor said Trump told them, ‘I feel like I could walk out of here today.’Within minutes, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows gave reporters a less rosy assessment, telling them, “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”Meadows, whose initial comments were delivered on condition that he not be identified, altered his tone hours later, telling Reuters that Trump was doing “very well” and that “doctors are very pleased with his vital signs.”Meadows did not clarify the discrepancy in his comments. A Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity said the president was not happy to learn of Meadows’ initial remarks.Administration officials have described the move to Walter Reed as precautionary and said Trump would stay at the hospital for several days.Another source who was briefed on Trump’s condition said the president was given supplemental oxygen before he went to the hospital. The decision to hospitalize Trump came after he had experienced difficulty breathing and his oxygen level dropped, according to a source familiar with the situation.White House doctor Sean P. Conley told reporters outside the hospital on Saturday that Trump had not had trouble breathing, and was not given oxygen at Walter Reed.“The team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made,” Conley said.He declined to give a timetable for Trump’s possible release from the hospital, and later had to issue a statement saying he misspoke after appearing to suggest Trump had been diagnosed as early as Wednesday.In a statement on Saturday evening, Conley said the president was “not yet out of the woods” but his team remained cautiously optimistic.“Today’s spectacle - doctors saying one thing, White House sources saying another thing, and both later amending their statements - only reinforces the credibility problems of this administration,” said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.The diagnosis was the latest setback for the Republican president, who is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.With Trump in the hospital, his campaign announced “Operation MAGA,” based on his slogan “Make America Great Again,” which will see high-profile allies including Vice President Mike Pence and Trump’s elder sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, take over in-person campaigning starting next week.Pence, who tested negative on Friday, is scheduled to debate Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Wednesday.Biden, who largely avoided direct criticism of Trump during a campaign trip to Michigan on Friday, took a more aggressive tone on Saturday while speaking to a transit workers’ union on Saturday, even as he wished the president well.“I’m in a little bit of a spot here, because I don’t want to be attacking the president and the first lady now,” Biden said, adding he hoped the Trumps make a full recovery.But he quickly pivoted to Trump’s response to the pandemic, calling it “unconscionable” and blasting Trump’s comment in an interview this summer that “it is what it is” when asked about the death toll.“I find this one of the most despicable things that I’ve encountered in my whole career,” Biden said.Biden, who tested negative on Friday, told reporters he would next be tested on Sunday. His campaign will begin releasing the results of each test, a spokesman said.The Democratic candidate has eschewed big events in favor of low-key appearances with few or no attendees, while Trump has held large rallies with little social distancing.Biden has used Trump’s diagnosis to bolster his calls for people to wear masks, a practice that Trump has questioned.Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus pandemic this year, even as it has killed more than 200,000 Americans and hammered the U.S. economy.Conley said Trump had received a first dose of a five-day course of Remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug sold by Gilead Sciences Inc that has been shown to shorten hospital stays.He is also taking an experimental treatment, Regeneron’s REGN-COV2, one of several experimental COVID-19 drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, as well as zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin, Conley has said.The president is at high risk because of his age and weight. He has remained in apparent good health during his time in office but is not known to exercise regularly or to follow a healthy diet.A number of other prominent Republicans have also said they tested positive for COVID-19 since Trump’s announcement, including Republican Senators Mike Lee, Thom Tillis and Ron Johnson, former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.Christie said he checked himself in to a hospital on Saturday as a precaution due to his asthma, though he said he had only mild symptoms."

His campaign will begin releasing the results of each test, a spokesman said.The Democratic candidate has eschewed big events in favor of low-key appearances with few or no attendees, while Trump has held large rallies with little social distancing.Biden has used Trump’s diagnosis to bolster his calls for people to wear masks, a practice that Trump has questioned.Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus pandemic this year, even as it has killed more than 200,000 Americans and hammered the U.S. economy.Conley said Trump had received a first dose of a five-day course of Remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug sold by Gilead Sciences Inc that has been shown to shorten hospital stays.He is also taking an experimental treatment, Regeneron’s REGN-COV2, one of several experimental COVID-19 drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, as well as zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin, Conley has said.The president is at high risk because of his age and weight. He has remained in apparent good health during his time in office but is not known to exercise regularly or to follow a healthy diet.A number of other prominent Republicans have also said they tested positive for COVID-19 since Trump’s announcement, including Republican Senators Mike Lee, Thom Tillis and Ron Johnson, former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway, and former New Jersey governor Chris Christie.Christie said he checked himself in to a hospital on Saturday as a precaution due to his asthma, though he said he had only mild symptoms."
2020-10-03,Trump to spend days at military hospital after COVID-19 diagnosis,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2GU01Q,"WASHINGTON, Oct 3 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump was in a military hospital on Saturday for treatment after testing positive for COVID-19, an extraordinary development that upended the presidential race a month before the Nov. 3 election.Roughly 17 hours after he made his diagnosis public, Trump walked slowly from the White House to a waiting helicopter to be taken to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. He wore a mask and business suit and did not speak to reporters.“I think I’m doing very well, but we’re going to make sure that things work out,” Trump said in a brief video message posted on Twitter. Early on Friday, he had tweeted that he and the first lady, Melania Trump, had contracted the virus.Trump will work in a special suite at the hospital for the next few days as a precautionary measure, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said. Online video showed a small group of Trump supporters outside Walter Reed late on Friday waving Trump 2020 flags, most not wearing masks.Trump, 74, has a mild fever, according to a source familiar with the matter. White House doctor Sean P. Conley said late on Friday that Trump was doing very well, did not need supplemental oxygen, and had received a first dose of Remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug sold by Gilead Sciences Inc that has been shown to shorten hospital stays.In a tweet late on Friday, the president wrote: “Going well, I think! Thank you to all. LOVE!!!”The diagnosis was the latest setback for the Republican president, who is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.Trump has played down the threat of the coronavirus pandemic from the outset, even as the disease has killed more than 200,000 Americans and hammered the U.S. economy.A number of other prominent Republicans also tested positive on Friday, including former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and Republican senators Mike Lee and Thom Tillis.Vice President Mike Pence, who would take over presidential duties if Trump became severely ill, tested negative, a spokesman said. The former Indiana governor, 61, is working from his own residence several miles from the White House.Trump is at high risk because of his age and weight. He has remained in apparent good health during his time in office but is not known to exercise regularly or to follow a healthy diet.Conley said earlier on Friday that Trump has received an experimental treatment, Regeneron’s REGN-COV2, one of several experimental COVID-19 drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are used for treating a wide range of illnesses.Trump is also taking zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin, Conley said.Stocks on Wall Street closed lower as news of Trump’s diagnosis added to mounting uncertainties surrounding the election.With just 31 days to go until Election Day, Trump’s campaign said it would postpone rallies and other events where he was scheduled to appear, or take them online.Trump’s campaign manager, Bill Stepien, also tested positive for COVID-19 on Friday and will work from home, according to a senior campaign official.Biden pulled ads attacking Trump off the air but otherwise continued his campaign, traveling to Michigan on Friday after testing negative for the virus.At a union hall in Grand Rapids, Biden said he was praying for his rival’s recovery. However, he also implicitly criticized Trump, who has mocked Biden for routinely wearing a mask and has held huge campaign rallies with little social distancing.“Be patriotic,” Biden said. “It’s not about being a tough guy. It’s about doing your part.”The Republican National Committee would choose a replacement nominee if Trump were to become incapacitated, but it is too late in most states to change the names on the ballot. Some 2.9 million people have already voted, according to figures compiled by University of Florida professor Michael McDonald.Pence took over Trump’s planned calls with governors and retirees’ organizations. His Oct. 7 debate with Democratic vice presidential candidate Kamala Harris will go forward as planned, organizers said.Harris has also tested negative, according to the campaign.The virus could complicate Trump’s push to install conservative judge Amy Coney Barrett on the Supreme Court.In addition to the president and his wife, at least four people who were at a White House event to announce Barrett’s nomination - Conway, Lee, Tillis and University of Notre Dame President John Jenkins - said Friday they have tested positive.Lee and Tillis are both members of the Republican-controlled Senate Judiciary Committee, which is scheduled to begin hearings on Barrett’s nomination on Oct. 12.Barrett herself tested positive for the virus earlier this year and recovered, according to a person familiar with the matter.Tillis, who said in a statement that he has no symptoms, will isolate at home for 10 days. Polls show a close race between him and Democratic challenger Cal Cunningham for his North Carolina seat, one of several Democrats hope to flip in their quest to win a Senate majority in November.Trump is the latest world leader to contract the virus.British Prime Minister Boris Johnson was rushed into intensive care after falling gravely ill in March. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro called the virus a “little flu” after being infected in July. Both men recovered."

One doctor said Trump told them, “I feel like I could walk out of here today.”Within minutes, White House chief of staff Mark Meadows gave reporters a less rosy assessment, telling them, “The president’s vitals over the last 24 hours were very concerning and the next 48 hours will be critical in terms of his care. We’re still not on a clear path to a full recovery.”Meadows, whose initial comments were delivered on condition that he not be identified, altered his tone hours later, telling Reuters that Trump was doing “very well” and that “doctors are very pleased with his vital signs.”Meadows did not clarify the discrepancy in his comments. A Trump adviser who spoke on condition of anonymity said the president was not happy to learn of Meadows’ initial remarks.Administration officials have described the move to Walter Reed as precautionary and said Trump would stay for several days.Another source who was briefed on Trump’s condition said the president was given supplemental oxygen before he went to the hospital. The decision to hospitalize Trump came after he had experienced difficulty breathing and his oxygen level dropped, according to a source familiar with the situation.White House doctor Sean P. Conley told reporters outside the hospital on Saturday that Trump had not had trouble breathing, and was not given oxygen at Walter Reed.“The team and I are extremely happy with the progress the president has made,” Conley said.He declined to give a timetable for Trump’s possible release from the hospital, and later had to issue a statement saying he misspoke after appearing to suggest Trump had been diagnosed as early as Wednesday.In a statement on Saturday evening, Conley said the president was “not yet out of the woods” but his team remained cautiously optimistic.“Today’s spectacle - doctors saying one thing, White House sources saying another thing, and both later amending their statements - only reinforces the credibility problems of this administration,” said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics.The diagnosis was the latest setback for the Republican president, who is trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 3 presidential election.With Trump off the campaign trail indefinitely, his campaign announced “Operation MAGA,” based on his slogan “Make America Great Again,” which will see high-profile allies including Vice President Mike Pence and Trump’s elder sons, Donald Jr. and Eric, take over in-person campaigning this week.Pence, who tested negative on Friday, is scheduled to debate Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris on Wednesday.Biden, who largely avoided direct criticism of Trump during a campaign trip to Michigan on Friday, took a more aggressive tone on Saturday while speaking to a transit workers’ union, even as he wished the president well.“I’m in a little bit of a spot here, because I don’t want to be attacking the president and the first lady now,” Biden said, adding he hoped the Trumps make a full recovery.But he quickly pivoted to Trump’s response to the pandemic, calling it “unconscionable” and blasting Trump’s comment in an interview this summer that “it is what it is” when asked about the death toll.“I find this one of the most despicable things that I’ve encountered in my whole career,” Biden said.Biden, who tested negative on Friday, told reporters he would next be tested on Sunday. His campaign will begin releasing the results of each test, a spokesman said.The Democratic candidate has eschewed big events in favor of low-key appearances with few or no attendees, while Trump has held large rallies with little social distancing.Biden has used Trump’s diagnosis to bolster his calls for people to wear masks, a practice Trump has questioned.Trump has repeatedly downplayed the threat of the coronavirus pandemic, even as it has killed more than 208,000 Americans and hammered the U.S. economy.Conley said Trump had received the first two doses of a five-day course of Remdesivir, an intravenous antiviral drug sold by Gilead Sciences Inc that has been shown to shorten hospital stays.He is also taking an experimental treatment, Regeneron’s REGN-COV2, as well as zinc, Vitamin D, famotidine, melatonin and aspirin, Conley has said.The president is at high risk because of his age, 74, and weight. He has remained in apparent good health during his time in office but is not known to exercise regularly or follow a healthy diet.A number of other prominent Republicans have also tested positive for the virus that causes COVID-19 since Trump’s announcement, including Republican senators Mike Lee, Thom Tillis and Ron Johnson, former White House senior adviser Kellyanne Conway and former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie.Christie said he checked himself in to a hospital on Saturday as a precaution due to his asthma, though he said he had only mild symptoms.

2020-10-06,GSK to widen COVID-19 antibody treatment trial after safety clearance,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2GX3RZ,"(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline and partner Vir Biotechnology will expand their trial of an experimental antibody to treat COVID-19 after initial use by a group of volunteers did not raise any safety concerns.The two partners in August started testing the antibody on early-stage COVID-19 patients, hoping to keep symptoms from progressing.Various firms are running tests in this promising class of antiviral drugs to combat the pandemic.After testing the drug on 20 U.S. participants for safety, the trial will now expand as planned to 1,300 patients globally.Half the participants will be randomly assigned to a control group receiving a placebo.Interim trial results may be available as early as the end of 2020. Complete efficacy results are expected as early as January or later in the first quarter of 2021.The long-acting single injection will be tested on recently diagnosed high-risk cases for its ability to prevent hospitalisation, typically a life threatening disease stage.An experimental two-antibody combination under development by Regeneron was mong the drugs used on U.S. President Donald Trump for his COVID-19 infection.That was only days after Regeneron, in a manufacturing partnership with Roche, said the drug was shown to reduce viral levels and improved symptoms at an early disease stage. That data would likely support a request for emergency use authorization.Eli Lilly, which will get manufacturing help from Amgen, last month also released data showing that one of its antibodies lowered patient virus levels and could prevent disease progression.Natural antibodies, part of the body’s adaptive immune system, are normally made by white blood cells in response to a foreign substance in the body.But pharma companies, also including AstraZeneca and Molecular Partners, are working on monoclonal antibodies made in bioreactors from living cells, for a more targeted attack on the virus."
2020-10-07,"Regeneron antibodies in demand after Trump treatment, doctors seek more data",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2GZ02U,"(Reuters) - Patients are asking to join clinical trials of antibody-based COVID-19 drugs after U.S. President Donald Trump was treated last week with an experimental therapy from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O, and on Wednesday he promised to make it free to Americans while touting its benefits.Medical experts said more data is needed to assess the treatment’s efficacy before wider use should be allowed.Trump was discharged from the hospital late on Monday, just a few days after being diagnosed with COVID-19 that caused enough lung inflammation for blood oxygen levels to fall.According to his doctor, blood tests on Monday detected infection-fighting antibodies, which a Regeneron spokesperson said were probably from the treatment.The company said on Wednesday that it has submitted a request to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for its antibody combination.In a video shot outside the White House, Trump credited the Regeneron therapy for his feeling much better than when he was first diagnosed and said he would push for EUAs of that treatment and others like it. He mistakenly said the drug was called Regeneron.Regeneron’s drug is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies - manufactured copies of antibodies that are one of the main weapons the immune system generates to fight infections.The company so far has released some early data pointing to the promise of its therapy for COVID-19, and doctors were concerned Trump’s treatment and subsequent promotion could put pressure on regulatorsDr. Gary Kleiner, a pediatric immunologist at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine and investigator in a trial designed to see if Regeneron’s antibodies can prevent coronavirus infection, said he has been approached by patients seeking the drug since last week.Dr. Dirk Sostman, head of the research network at Houston Methodist Hospital, a trial site for Regeneron and Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N antibody programs, said more patients are asking to participate in an antibody trial.He was cautious about broader use without more data.“All we have seen are very brief press releases ... so there is not much to go on,” he said.“The politics of the situation would suggest to me that the story could be Trump gets COVID ... then American technology fostered by the Trump Administration cures COVID,” Sostman added. “I would think there would be pressure on regulators.”Top U.S. infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci, speaking on Monday on CNN, said he was “strongly suspicious” that Regeneron’s drug has contributed to Trump’s progress. “Obviously you can’t prove that until you do a number of studies to show that it actually works,” he said.Doctors emphasized that the timeline for Trump’s illness was not entirely clear. “If he is responding at a pace where he is truly much better, it is going to be due to the antibodies,” said Dr. Edward Jones-Lopez, infectious disease specialist at the University of Southern California Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles.Giving the treatment to the president seems “a tacit endorsement by the federal medical bureaucracy for Regeneron’s medicine, and we expect an EUA for the treatment of COVID in a matter of days,” Leerink analyst Geoffrey Porges said in a research note.“Patients most likely to benefit from this treatment have a similar profile to President Trump, in that they had undetectable antibodies at baseline and were early in the course of disease,” Regeneron spokeswoman Alexandra Bowie said in an emailed statement.Regeneron has received $450 million from the U.S. government for up to 300,000 doses of the dual-antibody cocktail, and the company has said those supplies would be distributed free of charge.Eli Lilly on Wednesday said a mid-stage trial testing its combination antibody therapy showed that it helped cut hospitalization and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients and that it also planned to seek an EUA.Shares of Regeneron, up nearly 6% so far this month, closed at $591.69 on Wednesday. Lilly’s shares rose 3.4% on Wednesday to close at $148.96."

At least 19 people close to Trump have tested positive.Trump has depicted himself as a man who vanquished the disease and emerged stronger, telling Americans not to be afraid of COVID-19.The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted Oct. 2 to 6, found that 38% of adults approved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, while 56% said they disapproved.In a withering editorial, the New England Journal of here accused America's leaders of an astonishing degree of failure over the COVID-19 crisis that ""turned it into a tragedy.""Although Trump long defied experts by holding out the possibility that a vaccine might be available before the election, he acknowledged in his video message that a vaccine would be out after the ballot because of “politics.”Advisers say Trump wanted to be talking about other issues instead of the virus by this stage of the campaign, to put pressure on Biden. Opinion polls show Trump down double digits, and Biden with sizeable leads in many swing states."

2020-10-08,What we know - and don\'t know - about Trump\'s COVID-19 illness,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26T3OU,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump revealed early on Oct. 2 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, but several questions about the course of his illness remain unknown. The following is some of what is known and what is still unclear about the president’s bout with COVID-19.Who infected President Trump when?These are both questions that have not been answered as the White House has repeatedly refused to say when the president last tested negative for the coronavirus - information essential to tracing the timeline of when and where he was likely infected.Health experts say the timing of his positive test results suggest he likely contracted the illness in late September. On Sept. 26, Trump hosted a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden to announce his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. The mostly outdoor event was attended by more than 100 people, most not wearing masks and with no social distancing. Whether Trump was infected at the event or infected others there is unknown. At least eight attendees, including the president, first lady and some top aides, tested positive afterwards, the New York Times reported.Trump may have contracted the virus from a member of his staff. On Oct. 1, White House aide Hope Hicks was diagnosed with COVID-19 and began to self-isolate. Hicks travels regularly with the president on Air Force One and accompanied him to Ohio for the presidential debate the previous Tuesday and to Minnesota for a campaign event on Wednesday. Several other members of his staff, including senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, have since tested positive for COVID-19. Some experts said Trump’s symptoms and those experienced by Hicks first appeared too close together to make it likely that Hicks infected the president.It generally takes 5 to 7 days after infection for COVID-19 to be detected on a typical molecular diagnostic test, said Otto Yang, a physician at UCLA Health. The Wall Street Journal reported Trump first tested positive on a rapid test used for screening White House staff earlier on Thursday that was later confirmed by a more accurate lab test. He did not disclose his positive test until about 1 am ET (0500 GMT) after the news broke that Hicks had tested positive.Was the president seriously ill?Trump was ill enough to cause concern among his doctors and to convince him he should be treated at a hospital and not at the White House. Several pieces of evidence indicate Trump may have been seriously ill, but his aides and medical team have provided conflicting information. Sources told Reuters he suffered a mild fever and his doctor at the time said he was “fatigued but in good spirits.” At briefings, his doctor gave unusually rosy reports while avoiding specific questions that would give a much more clear picture of Trump’s condition. For example, they declined to discuss his lung scans or say whether he had pneumonia or whether blood tests showed markers for inflammation, a sign of more serious illness.Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland from Friday, Oct. 2 to the following Monday and had two known instances of low oxygen levels, a sign of more serious illness. He received many of the medicines that have shown some efficacy against COVID-19 in clinical trials, painting a confusing picture of how severely ill he may have been, physicians told Reuters.He received an experimental dual antibody therapy developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O that is so new it does not yet have an official name. That treatment can be given early in the course of the disease. He also received a five-day course of Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral remdesivir, which is often used for severely ill patients but can be given early in the illness. And he is taking the steroid dexamethasone, which experts have said should be reserved to prevent death in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Because the steroid suppresses the immune system's natural response, it can actually worsen a more mild illness, Yang said.Trump’s physician said blood samples taken on Monday show the president had protective antibodies, but those were likely the Regeneron antibodies rather than a natural response, the company and other health experts said.In a series of videos this week, Trump proclaimed himself cured, possibly immune, and touted the benefits of the Regeneron therapy. U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci noted on Thursday that we do not know if the president is well, because patients can unexpectedly go downhill more than a week after symptoms begin.Has the president infected anyone?The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that patients avoid contact with others for 10 days after the onset of symptoms.

2020-10-08,EXPLAINER-What we know - and don\'t know - about Trump\'s COVID-19 illness,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2GY2ES,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump revealed early on Oct. 2 that he had tested positive for the coronavirus, but several questions about the course of his illness remain unknown. The following is some of what is known and what is still unclear about the president’s bout with COVID-19.Who infected President Trump when?These are both questions that have not been answered as the White House has repeatedly refused to say when the president last tested negative for the coronavirus - information essential to tracing the timeline of when and where he was likely infected.Health experts say the timing of his positive test results suggest he likely contracted the illness in late September. On Sept. 26, Trump hosted a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden to announce his Supreme Court nominee, Amy Coney Barrett. The mostly outdoor event was attended by more than 100 people, most not wearing masks and with no social distancing. Whether Trump was infected at the event or infected others there is unknown. At least eight attendees, including the president, first lady and some top aides, tested positive afterwards, the New York Times reported.Trump may have contracted the virus from a member of his staff. On Oct. 1, White House aide Hope Hicks was diagnosed with COVID-19 and began to self-isolate. Hicks travels regularly with the president on Air Force One and accompanied him to Ohio for the presidential debate the previous Tuesday and to Minnesota for a campaign event on Wednesday. Several other members of his staff, including senior White House adviser Stephen Miller, have since tested positive for COVID-19. Some experts said Trump’s symptoms and those experienced by Hicks first appeared too close together to make it likely that Hicks infected the president.It generally takes 5 to 7 days after infection for COVID-19 to be detected on a typical molecular diagnostic test, said Otto Yang, a physician at UCLA Health. The Wall Street Journal reported Trump first tested positive on a rapid test used for screening White House staff earlier on Thursday that was later confirmed by a more accurate lab test. He did not disclose his positive test until about 1 am ET (0500 GMT) after the news broke that Hicks had tested positive.Was the president seriously ill?Trump was ill enough to cause concern among his doctors and to convince him he should be treated at a hospital and not at the White House. Several pieces of evidence indicate Trump may have been seriously ill, but his aides and medical team have provided conflicting information. Sources told Reuters he suffered a mild fever and his doctor at the time said he was “fatigued but in good spirits.” At briefings, his doctor gave unusually rosy reports while avoiding specific questions that would give a much more clear picture of Trump’s condition. For example, they declined to discuss his lung scans or say whether he had pneumonia or whether blood tests showed markers for inflammation, a sign of more serious illness.Trump was hospitalized at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland from Friday, Oct. 2 to the following Monday and had two known instances of low oxygen levels, a sign of more serious illness. He received many of the medicines that have shown some efficacy against COVID-19 in clinical trials, painting a confusing picture of how severely ill he may have been, physicians told Reuters.He received an experimental dual antibody therapy developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O that is so new it does not yet have an official name. That treatment can be given early in the course of the disease. He also received a five-day course of Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral remdesivir, which is often used for severely ill patients but can be given early in the illness. And he is taking the steroid dexamethasone, which experts have said should be reserved to prevent death in severely ill COVID-19 patients. Because the steroid suppresses the immune system's natural response, it can actually worsen a more mild illness, Yang said.Trump’s physician said blood samples taken on Monday show the president had protective antibodies, but those were likely the Regeneron antibodies rather than a natural response, the company and other health experts said.In a series of videos this week, Trump proclaimed himself cured, possibly immune, and touted the benefits of the Regeneron therapy. U.S. infectious disease chief Dr. Anthony Fauci noted on Thursday that we do not know if the president is well, because patients can unexpectedly go downhill more than a week after symptoms begin.Has the president infected anyone?The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that patients avoid contact with others for 10 days after the onset of symptoms. That means Trump should assume he is contagious through Saturday, Oct. 10, if he was first symptomatic on Oct. 1.People are believed to be at their most contagious in the days just before symptoms arise. Since it is not known when Trump last tested negative, he could have been spreading the virus for days before testing positive. Trump put some of his Secret Service detail at risk on Oct. 1, when he left the hospital in a motorcade to wave to supporters, experts said. He and others in his car wore masks but were in close proximity in the hermetically sealed vehicle.

Fox Business Network said the interview would air on Thursday after 8 a.m. (1200 GMT).Itching to get back out on the campaign trail since leaving a military hospital on Monday, Trump has called off negotiations with Congress for a fresh round of stimulus for the ailing economy and declared in a video that his illness was “a gift from God.”National opinion polls show Trump trailing Democratic rival Joe Biden ahead of the November election, with Biden also showing an advantage in battleground states critical to winning the Electoral College.Trump has faced criticism for underestimating the novel coronavirus, which has killed more than 210,000 Americans and thrown millions out of work. Even since revealing his own illness on Friday, Trump has downplayed the respiratory disease’s dangers and been censured by social media platforms for spreading misinformation about it.“I think this was a blessing from God that I caught it. This was a blessing in disguise,” Trump said in the video posted to his Twitter account on Wednesday, adding his use of an experimental medication from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc had allowed him to experience first-hand how effective it could be.He vowed to make the treatment available free of charge, but did not say how he would do that or who would pay the cost of the treatments. The United States is currently reporting more than 44,000 new COVID-19 infections each day.Trump himself has not been seen in public since he flew by helicopter on Monday from Walter Reed Military Medical Center outside Washington to the White House in a made-for-TV spectacle.‘GREATEST FAILURE’Despite his illness, Trump has been looking for ways to get his election message out and cut into Biden’s lead in battleground states, advisers said.A speech to senior voters is being contemplated for Thursday, they said.Trump has had no COVID-19 symptoms for the past 24 hours, his doctor, Sean Conley, said in a statement on Wednesday“He’s now been fever-free for more than four days, symptom-free for over 24 hours, and has not needed, nor received, any supplemental oxygen since initial hospitalization,” Conley said.Trump’s vice president, Mike Pence, and Democratic vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris debated on Wednesday night in Salt Lake City, their only matchup ahead of the Nov. 3 election.“The American people have witnessed what is the greatest failure of any presidential administration in the history of our country,” Harris said.A wave of infections at the White House among Trump’s top lieutenants and press aides has left the West Wing struggling to find its footing. At least 19 people close to Trump have tested positive.Trump has depicted himself as a man who vanquished the disease and emerged stronger, telling Americans not to be afraid of COVID-19. Harris faulted him for failing to be honest with the American people about the risks posed by virus.The latest Reuters/Ipsos poll, conducted from Friday to Tuesday, found that 56% of U.S. adults disapproved of Trump’s handling of the coronavirus, with just 38% approving. Two-thirds said they believed he could have avoided becoming sick if he had taken the disease seriously, rather than eschewing face coverings and social-distancing guidelines.In a withering editorial, the New England Journal of here accused the federal government of an astonishing degree of failure over the COVID-19 crisis that ""turned it into a tragedy.""In his video address, Trump repeatedly stressed how well he felt so far in his recovery from COVID-19. His doctors have provided only limited details about his condition.The video’s release followed White House assurances that the 74-year-old president was back at the Oval Office on Wednesday, getting briefed about economic stimulus talks and Hurricane Delta.

Now, with the Delta variant pushing U.S. COVID-19 cases well above 100,000 per day, test makers are working to quickly reverse course.Contaminant in Moderna vaccines suspected to be metallic particles, NHK saysA contaminant found in a batch of Moderna Inc’s COVID-19 vaccines delivered to Japan is believed to be a metallic particle, Japanese public broadcaster NHK reported, citing sources at the health ministry. NHK, in a report published late on Thursday, cited ministry sources as saying the particle reacted to magnets and was therefore suspected to be a metal. Moderna has described it as “particulate matter” that did not pose a safety or efficacy issue.Spanish pharma company Rovi, which bottles Moderna vaccines for markets other than the United States, said the contamination could be due to a manufacturing issue in a production line and that it was conducting an investigation.Biden shedding support from independent voters as Delta variant spreads, polling showsPresident Joe Biden is shedding support from independents, a crucial voting bloc that helped Democrats win the White House and Congress last year, as a resurgence of COVID-19 cases slows the country’s return to normal from the pandemic, Reuters/Ipsos polling shows.The pandemic has surged anew in the United States, especially in populous Republican-led states such as Florida and Texas that have resisted new restrictions to hamper the spread of the Delta variant of the virus.Mexican researchers say they have created a mask that neutralizes COVID-19Researchers at the National Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM) have created a mask using silver and copper nanolayers that neutralizes SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, the university said in its official gazette on Thursday.UNAM said that if the viral concentration was high, the virus disappeared by more than 80% in about eight hours and if the viral load was low, in two hours none of the virus RNA was detected."

That would top 1 million doses by the end of the year, he said.Trump received Regeneron’s treatment last week. In a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh on Friday, Trump said he is working to get both drugs approved quickly and that he may not have recovered without the treatments he received.Both companies have said the drugs were shown to work in clinical trials and that they have submitted an emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The drugs are not identical: Regeneron’s treatment is a cocktail of two antibodies meant to protect against the virus, while Lilly’s is a single antibody.

2020-10-09,"U.S. expects over 1 million COVID-19 antibody doses from Regeneron, Lilly in 2020",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26U1W2,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government expects to be able to provide at no cost more than 1 million doses of antibody treatments for COVID-19 similar to the one President Donald Trump received to treat his illness, according to a top U.S. health official on Friday.The government's Operation Warp Speed program currently has ""a couple of hundred thousand doses"" of the monoclonal antibody treatments being developed by drugmakers Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc REGN.O and Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services official Paul Mango said on a call with reporters. That would top 1 million doses by the end of the year, he said.Trump received Regeneron’s treatment last week. In a radio interview with Rush Limbaugh on Friday, Trump said he is working to get both drugs approved quickly and that he may not have recovered without the treatments he received.Both companies have said the drugs were shown to work in clinical trials and that they have submitted an emergency use authorization to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).The drugs are not identical: Regeneron’s treatment is a cocktail of two antibodies meant to protect against the virus, while Lilly’s is a single antibody. Because they have not been tested against the other, it is difficult to know if one is more effective than the other.It is unclear how long the FDA process to authorize emergency use of the drugs will take. Unless the companies receive that authorization, doctors cannot administer the drugs to patients outside of clinical trials or without a compassionate use authorization like the one President Trump received.If the drugs are authorized for use by the FDA, Mango said that the government will allocate the treatments to the states based on need, similar to the mechanism used with Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir for COVID-19.

2020-10-12,Takeda group begins manufacturing COVID-19 plasma treatment ahead of approval,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26X2MW,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Takeda Pharmaceutical Co-led group that is developing a blood plasma treatment for COVID-19 has started manufacturing while the late-stage trial to determine whether it works is ongoing, Takeda 4502.T Chief Executive Christophe Weber said on Monday.The group, known as the CoVIg Plasma Alliance, enrolled its first patient in the Phase III trial on Friday after months of delays. It aims to enroll 500 adult patients from the United States, Mexico and 16 other countries and hope to have results by the end of the year.“The likelihood it works is very high,” Weber said in an interview. “And that’s why we have launched a campaign in order to accelerate the donation of convalescent plasma to manufacture and produce this product.”The alliance, which includes CSL Behring, Germany's Biotest AG BIOG.DE and other companies, is testing a hyperimmune globulin therapy, which is derived from blood plasma of people who have recovered from COVID-19. Hyperimmune globulin therapy offers a standardized dose of antibodies and does not need to be limited to patients with matching blood types.That makes it more advanced and convenient than treatment with convalescent plasma drawn from recovered patients.The manufacturing process is expensive.Weber said the treatment could be slightly more costly to make than monoclonal antibody treatments like the ones Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O and Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N have developed. The alliance does not intend to profit from the treatment, Weber said.The Takeda CEO said he does not know how many doses of the treatment the group will be able to produce by the end of the year. That will depend on donations as well as the dosage size they decide to test in the clinical trial.The trial will test the hyperimmune globulin therapy in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir compared with patients who get remdesivir alone, he said."

(bit.ly/3lKi1km)“The goal here is to identify as quickly as possible the experimental therapeutics that demonstrate the most clinical promise as COVID-19 treatments and move them into larger-scale testing,” said NIAID Director and U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci.Gilead’s remdesivir, which was among the first to be used to treat COVID-19 and received emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in May, has since been authorized for use in several other countries.Risankizumab and lenzilumab belong to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies that are laboratory-made versions of proteins naturally produced by the immune system in response to invading viruses or other pathogens.The treatment has come under the spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump was treated with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals’ antibody drug earlier this month.Regeneron and Eli Lilly have both applied to the U.S. FDA for emergency use of their antibody treatments."

2020-10-14,CORRECTED-U.S. pauses Eli Lilly trial of antibody drug Trump touted as COVID-19 \'cure\' over safety concern,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2H41NW,"(This Oct. 13 story corrects the headline and paragraphs 1 and 9 to show the federal government, not Eli Lilly, made the decision to pause a clinical trial of the company’s antibody drug)(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N said on Tuesday that the government-sponsored clinical trial of its COVID-19 antibody treatment similar to one taken by U.S. President Donald Trump has been paused by the U.S. government because of a safety concern.Trump touted the Lilly drug, along with the antibody treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O that he received for his COVID-19, as tantamount to a cure in a video he posted last week. The announcement comes one day after Johnson & Johnson JNJ.N said it was forced to pause a large high-profile trial of its experimental coronavirus vaccine because a volunteer fell ill. J&J said it does not yet know if that person was given the vaccine or a placebo.AstraZeneca Plc's AZN.L U.S. trial for its experimental COVID-19 vaccine has also been on hold for over a month after a volunteer in its UK study fell ill. Trials of that vaccine resumed in other regions after a brief halt.Lilly said earlier this month it was applying for emergency use authorization (EUA) for the antibody drug, LY-CoV555, for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 based on data from another clinical trial.It is not uncommon to pause drug trials to investigate safety concerns, and such actions do not necessarily indicate a serious problem. Because of the urgent need for drugs and vaccines to tackle a pandemic that has claimed over 1 million lives worldwide - and the speed with which they are being developed - these trials have come under intense scrutiny.“Out of an abundance of caution, the ACTIV-3 independent data safety monitoring board (DSMB) has recommended a pause in enrollment,” Lilly spokeswoman Molly McCully said in an emailed statement. “Lilly is supportive of the decision by the independent DSMB to cautiously ensure the safety of the patients participating in this study.”The Indianapolis-based drugmaker did not comment on the implications for the paused trial, called ACTIV-3, which is testing the treatment on COVID-19 patients who require hospitalization, or on its other ongoing trials. It is also testing the drug in nursing homes to see if it can prevent staff and residents from getting infected.Lilly is conducting the trial in partnership with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), a division of National Institutes of Health (NIH). NIAID said it paused the trial at the recommendation of the data and safety monitoring board.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not immediately reply to requests for comment.The ACTIV-3 trial began in August and is aiming to recruit 10,000 patients primarily in the United States.The trial compares patients who receive Lilly's antibody drug plus Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir with those who receive remdesivir alone.

2020-10-14,Exclusive: FDA faults quality control at Lilly plant making Trump-touted COVID drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26Y30C,"(This Oct. 13 story corrects to show that the federal government, not Eli Lilly, made the decision to pause a clinical trial of the company’s antibody drug, paragraph 10)(Reuters) - U.S. drug inspectors uncovered serious quality control problems at an Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N pharmaceutical plant that is ramping up to manufacture one of two promising COVID-19 drugs touted by President Trump as “a cure” for the disease, according to government documents and three sources familiar with the matter.The Lilly antibody therapy, which is experimental and not yet approved by regulators as safe and effective, is similar to a drug from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O that was given to the president during his bout with COVID-19.Trump, who credits the Regeneron drug with speeding his recovery, has called for both therapies to become available immediately on an emergency basis, raising expectations among some scientists and policy experts that the administration will imminently release an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) for the drug. The president’s push is key to his efforts to convince voters he has an answer to the pandemic that has killed more than 215,000 Americans.But the findings by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors at the Lilly manufacturing facility, which have not been disclosed previously, could complicate the drugmaker’s bid for an EUA from the federal agency, two of the sources and two outside legal experts told Reuters. That’s because U.S. law generally requires compliance with manufacturing standards for authorization of a drug.The three sources who spoke to Reuters requested that their names be withheld so they could speak freely without fear of retaliation.Inspectors who visited the Lilly plant in Branchburg, New Jersey, last November found that data on the plant’s various manufacturing processes had been deleted and not appropriately audited, government inspection documents show.“The deleted incidents and related audit trail were not reviewed by the quality unit,” the FDA inspectors wrote. Because the government inspection documents reviewed by Reuters were heavily redacted by the FDA it was not possible to see the inspectors’ more specific findings.Following its November inspection, the FDA classified the problems as the most serious level of violation, resulting in an “Official Action Indicated” (OAI) notice.That “means that the violations are serious enough and have a significant enough impact on the public health that something needs to be fixed,” said Patricia Zettler, a former associate chief counsel at the FDA who is now a law professor at Ohio State University.Separately, Lilly said this week that the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases paused a government-backed clinical trial of its COVID-19 drug in hospitalized patients “out of an abundance of caution” over a potential safety concern. The company said it supported the decision. It did not release information on what the problem was and declined to say how the news might affect their EUA request.In response to Reuters’ questions on Monday about the manufacturing issues, Lilly confirmed the OAI notice but declined to provide details on what prompted the FDA action. The drugmaker said it has launched a “comprehensive remediation plan,” has increased staffing at the site and was working “aggressively” to address all concerns raised during the inspection.The data deletions cited by the FDA, Lilly said, were not related to production of the drug.“These findings do not impact product quality or patient safety, as outlined in a detailed assessment submitted to FDA,” the company’s statement said. “Lilly continues to provide updates to the FDA on progress towards completion of our detailed plan.”The drugmaker declined to provide a copy of the assessment it gave the FDA.The FDA did not respond to requests for comment. The White House declined to comment.One of the sources told Reuters that Lilly employees had complained about problems at the plant, including insufficient staffing and falsified records tracking whether workers had followed FDA manufacturing standards.Lilly said the FDA has not made any findings of falsification at the site.Out of 563 total inspections concluded in fiscal year 2019 by the FDA across the country, only a small fraction resulted in the most serious OAI classification, FDA data shows, and no other Lilly facility has received such a notice in at least 10 years.None of Regeneron’s facilities have received OAIs based on inspections through the end of October 2019, FDA records show. Regeneron said in a statement it was “proud” of the company’s efforts to comply with manufacturing requirements, which “is reflected in our FDA inspection record.”Lilly has not disclosed the FDA inspections in its U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings. U.S. courts, in cases involving other companies, have ruled that such information could be material to investors. But that depends on several factors, including the severity of the FDA’s findings, as well as whether the company has failed to correct the deficiencies.In its statement to Reuters, Lilly did not respond to a question about why the inspections weren’t disclosed.Trump had previously focused on a promise to deliver a coronavirus vaccine by the Nov. 3 election, but that effort has since lost momentum due to doubts that any drugmaker will have enough proof of safety and efficacy in the coming weeks.Now under increased pressure to act swiftly against the pandemic, the FDA has discretion to approve Lilly’s COVID-19 therapy for emergency use even if the manufacturing issues have not been fully resolved.The FDA has already been criticized by some scientists and politicians for issuing EUAs for use of anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine and convalescent plasma treatment in coronavirus patients, despite little or problematic data. The agency ultimately withdrew its authorization for hydroxychloroquine and the plasma authorization remains in place.The Branchburg plant specializes in a range of drugs that are injected by syringe or infused intravenously. Partly because of the risk of contamination, such treatments are more complex to make than conventional pills and require additional vigilance to ensure quality and safety, pharmaceutical experts say.Lilly’s drug, known as LY-CoV555, is a manufactured copy of an antibody from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Known as monoclonal antibodies, such treatments work by recognizing and locking onto foreign invaders to block infection of healthy cells.Leading scientists have pointed to antibody drugs as a promising way to treat people who are already sick, and also to temporarily prevent infection in people at high risk of COVID-19, until a successful vaccine is identified.Lilly’s clinical trial data thus far show its therapy may help reduce hospital stays and emergency room visits for COVID-19 patients. The company has asked U.S. regulators to approve emergency use of the drug for higher-risk patients who have been recently diagnosed with mild to moderate coronavirus.Antibody drugs for the coronavirus are very limited in number, but Lilly says it expects to produce around one million doses of the treatment by the end of this year.The Trump administration’s program to accelerate development of COVID-19 vaccines and therapies, dubbed Operation Warp Speed, has already reached a $450 million deal with Regeneron for up to 300,000 treatment doses of its antibody treatment, REGN-COV2.No such agreement has been reached with Lilly, but the government’s interest in its therapy appears keen. Earlier this month, Warp Speed officials traveled to Branchburg to meet with Lilly executives, according to two sources briefed on the visit. Among the attendees were Lilly Chief Executive David Ricks and Chief Science Officer Dan Skovronsky, one source said.A potential complication is the former relationship between Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and Lilly, where he held a high-level position until 2017. Generally, he would have to sign off on a waiver for any company seeking an EUA that had been cited by the FDA for manufacturing problems. But because he is a former Lilly executive, Azar’s involvement in the deliberations could pose a potential conflict of interest, legal experts said.An HHS spokeswoman said Azar is not prohibited from participating in the deliberations about Lilly’s manufacturing issues or its EUA. But she said that in general, Azar has delegated his emergency authorization powers to the FDA.HHS did not make Azar available for comment.Lilly acquired the New Jersey site when it bought ImClone Systems in 2008, and over the next ten years the FDA inspected the facility several times and found no serious problems.That changed last November.Two inspectors spent ten days at the facility, according to the redacted copy of their report, known as a “483 letter”, which was reviewed by Reuters. The FDA inspectors described problems with “appropriate controls over computers and production systems,” and noted that data had been “deleted” and went unreviewed by company auditors.After the November 2019 inspection, the FDA returned to the Lilly site for a follow up audit and found additional problems in August, issuing a second 483 letter, according to an FDA inspection log.Among the problems: Lilly did not always have proper laboratory controls for drugs manufactured at the plant, the November inspection report said. One source said, for instance, that the plant failed to maintain systems meant to ensure that a popular anti-migraine drug, Emgality, met strength and purity standards.If the issues aren’t fixed, then the FDA could escalate the matter by issuing a warning letter, which sets out a deadline for correcting the problems. Ultimately, the FDA could order a company to cease producing certain drugs at a facility.Lilly said it had not received a warning letter.Meanwhile, Trump is leaning on the FDA for a quick approval of the antibody drugs. He does not have the authority to issue an EUA under the law.However, he said in a video last week “I have emergency use authorization all set. And we’ve got to get it signed now.”"

2020-10-14,Eli Lilly says other COVID-19 antibody drug trials ongoing after study halted for safety concern,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26Z21O,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly & Co on Wednesday said other trials of its experimental coronavirus antibody therapy remain on track after a government-run study testing the treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was paused due to safety concerns.Lilly said on Tuesday that an independent safety monitoring board requested a pause in the trial, called ACTIV-3, due to a potential safety issue.The National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is collaborating with Lilly on the trial, said the advisory board paused the trial after seeing a “difference in clinical status” between patients on Lilly’s drug on those who received a placebo, without providing further detail.“They’ve crossed the boundary” for an acceptable level of safety concerns in the trial, said Dr. Richard Chaisson, professor of medicine at Johns Hopkins who was not involved with the study. “Now they have to decide whether the boundary is important enough that they should stop the trial altogether, declare it unsafe.”Lilly on Wednesday said the paused trial is distinct from others it is conducting because it focuses on hospitalized patients who are more severely ill and being treated with other drugs as well, including Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral remdesivir.The company had already asked U.S. regulators for an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the antibody drug, called bamlanivimab or LY-CoV555, to treat mild to moderate COVID-19 patients, based on interim data from a different study in those less severe illness. It is also testing the drug in nursing homes to see if it can prevent staff and residents from getting infected.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the EUA application.LY-CoV555 is similar to the experimental dual-antibody therapy from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc that was used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump. That treatment is also awaiting clearance by U.S. regulators.Trump touted both drugs as being tantamount to cures in a video he posted last week after being released from the hospital.Lilly said in a statement that these type of treatments may prove to be less beneficial for hospitalized patients than for those with more mild cases of the disease. A Lilly spokeswoman declined to comment further on why the trial was halted.The paused trial is being conducted in partnership with the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, a division of the NIH that is working with several drugmakers on COVID-19 treatments and vaccines.It was halted at the request of an independent oversight panel, called a Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB). It is not uncommon to pause drug trials to investigate safety concerns, and such actions do not necessarily indicate a serious problem.“Lilly trusts the judgment of the independent DSMB and supports its decisions to exercise caution in ensuring the safety of the patients participating in this study,” the company said in a statement."
2020-10-14,"Trump\'s son Barron tested positive for COVID-19, says Melania Trump",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2H521D,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s 14-year-old son, Barron, tested positive for COVID-19 but exhibited no symptoms after both of his parents contracted the virus, first lady Melania Trump said on Wednesday.“Luckily he is a strong teenager and exhibited no symptoms,” Melania Trump said in a statement. She said she and Barron had since tested negative for the virus.Donald Trump told a rally in Des Moines, Iowa, that Barron “is just fine now” and said it was an example of why schools should reopen.“I don’t even think he knew he had it, because they’re young and their immune systems are strong and they fight it off,” Trump said. “Get the kids back to school,” he said.Melania Trump said her symptoms were “minimal” and that she hoped to resume her duties as first lady “as soon as I can.”“I experienced body aches, a cough and headaches, and felt extremely tired most of the time,” she said.“I chose to go a more natural route in terms of medicine, opting more for vitamins and healthy food,” Melania Trump said.Donald Trump spent three nights in a military hospital after announcing on Oct. 2 that he and Melania had tested positive.To treat the virus, he received an experimental dual antibody therapy developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral remdesivir, as well as the steroid dexamethasone.“In one way I was glad the three of us went through this at the same time so we could take care of one another and spend time together,” Melania Trump said."
2020-10-14,Top U.S. health official Fauci says Trump no longer coronavirus contagious: CBS interview,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26Z31Z,"(Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is no longer capable of spreading the novel coronavirus and can attend a town hall on Thursday without putting others at risk, top U.S. public health official Anthony Fauci said in an interview with CBS Evening News.Fauci said that he and his colleague Clifford Lane at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) concluded this after reviewing all the COVID-19 tests taken by the president as well as an additional test conducted at an NIH laboratory.Trump revealed early on Oct. 2 that he had tested positive for the novel coronavirus. He said he had recovered and was no longer contagious the following week.The town hall with NBC News is less than three weeks before the election in which Republican Trump is trailing Democratic candidate Joe Biden in opinion polls.Fauci also said in the CBS interview that the United States was unlikely to have 100 million doses of a vaccine deemed by regulators as “safe and effective” available by the end of the year, contrary to a claim Trump made in September.Enough vaccines to inoculate the general population might be possible by April 2021 if all of the experimental vaccines in late stage clinical trials prove effective, Fauci said. A couple of the vaccine candidates could potentially receive regulatory clearance in November or December but only “a few million” doses may be available to the public by year-end.He added that the experimental antibody drug made by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc that was used to treat the President, and which Trump said he wants to make free to all Americans, is not yet available in sufficient supply to provide to all COVID-19 patients. It is still awaiting U.S. regulatory clearance."
2020-10-15,Fact check: The recovery of Trump and Johnson from COVID-19 does not prove vaccines are unnecessary,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2701GY,"A post has been shared on Facebook saying that the recovery of U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson from COVID-19 “proves” there is no need for a vaccine. This claim is false.An example can be seen here . The image shows a meme shared by a Facebook user with the caption: “2 extremely overweight puppets make (sic) miraculous recovery from fatal pandemic virus, thanks to simple health care, yet we have to take a vaccine even if we are extremely fit and healthy? Yeh, righto”.The meme itself shows Trump and Johnson shaking hands with the words: “These two...have just proved that there is no need for a vaccine...think!!!”.It is misleading to describe the treatment Johnson and Trump received for COVID-19 as “simple health care”, as they both received different treatments in hospital.Boris Johnson was admitted to hospital on April 5, 2020, and taken into intensive care the following day. He received oxygen treatment and was discharged on April 12. Reuters reported this information at the time here and here .When Trump tested positive for COVID-19 in early October, he received an experimental cocktail of antibodies being tested by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (here), alongside zinc, vitamin D, aspirin and other generic drugs (here) . He returned to the White House on October 5 after three nights in hospital.Although Trump and Johnson recovered from the novel coronavirus, not everyone does. More than a million people have died globally from COVID-19 (here) and figures from the World Health Organisation show that the United States has the highest total death toll, with 213,626 deaths recorded as of Oct 15, 2020 (here) .While “extremely fit and healthy” people without underlying conditions, particularly those who are young, may be less likely to experience a severe form of the disease, they are still able to pass on the virus to others who are more at risk.Many experts therefore see a safe and effective vaccine as the only way out of the pandemic.Britain’s National Health Service website says: “Vaccines are the most effective way to prevent infectious diseases” (here). The British Health Secretary, Matt Hancock, described a vaccine as “our best hope of defeating coronavirus” (here) .In the US, the leading expert on infectious diseases, Dr. Anthony Fauci, said of the pandemic in an August Q&A (here) : “It will end because the public health efforts will succeed ultimately. And science will get us through this. We will get a vaccine. We will get therapies for early disease and for late disease”.False. The recovery of Trump and Johnson from COVID-19 does not prove that a vaccine is unnecessary.This article was produced by the Reuters Fact Check team.

2020-10-16,Gilead questions WHO study that cast doubts on drug\'s COVID-19 benefits,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27032N,"(Reuters) - Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O has questioned the findings of a World Health Organization (WHO) study that concluded its COVID-19 drug remdesivir does not help patients who have been admitted to hospital.The American company told Reuters the data appeared inconsistent, the findings were premature and that other studies had validated the drug’s benefits.In a blow to one of the few drugs being used to treat people with COVID-19, the WHO said on Thursday its “Solidarity” trial had concluded that remdesivir appeared to have little or no effect on 28-day mortality or length of hospital stays among patients with the respiratory disease.The antiviral medication was one of the drugs used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump’s coronavirus infection, and has been shown in previous studies to have cut time to recovery, though the European Union is investigating it for possible kidney injury.The WHO trial was conducted in 11,266 adult patients in more than 30 countries. The evidence was conclusive, the WHO said.Gilead said other trials of remdesivir, including with 1,062 patients that compared it with a placebo, showed the treatment cut COVID-19 recovery time.“The emerging (WHO) data appears inconsistent, with more robust evidence from multiple randomized, controlled studies published in peer-reviewed journals validating the clinical benefit of remdesivir,” Gilead told Reuters.Gilead said it was “unclear if any conclusive findings can be drawn” given what it called differences in how the trial was conducted from site to site and between the patients who received the medicine.In April, the top U.S. infectious disease official, Anthony Fauci, predicted remdesivir would become “the standard of care”.Companies such as Gilead are racing to find a treatment for COVID-19. Some 1.1 million people have died and 39.1 million have been reported infected in the pandemic, and the global economy has been thrown into chaos.Remdesivir was developed for Ebola, which causes fever, bleeding, vomiting and diarrhoea and spreads among humans through bodily fluids.It was quickly repurposed and has offered some hope for patients, though the WHO's findings may shift the focus of the search for a vaccine to new monoclonal antibodies being developed by companies including Regeneron REGN.O.The Solidarity trial also evaluated hydroxychloroquine, anti-HIV drug combination lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon, and concluded that they, like remdesivir, did little to help patients survive or leave the hospital more quickly.The WHO trial's results are yet to be reviewed and were uploaded on the preprint server medRxiv. (bit.ly/3nViYIf)“PREMATURE”Gilead say the Solidarity conclusions, lacking scrutiny from other scientists, were premature.“We are concerned the data from this open-label global trial has not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion, particularly given the limitations of the trial design,” it said.Remdesivir got emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 1, and has been authorized for use in several countries.During the Solidarity study, trials of hydroxychloroquine and lopinavir/ritonavir were stopped in June after they proved ineffective, but the studies of Gilead’s drug and interferon continued in more than 500 hospitals and 30 countries.WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan said this week the U.N. health agency was now looking at other, emerging treatment options such as monoclonal anti-bodies, immunomodulators and some newer anti-viral drugs.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O is developing a monoclonal antibody that Trump received for his COVID-19 infection.Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N said on Tuesday a trial of its COVID-19 antibody treatment had been paused by the U.S. government because of a safety concern."
2020-10-16,Row breaks out over WHO trial casting doubt on remdesivir as COVID-19 drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2711IT,"ZURICH/GENEVA (Reuters) - A row broke out on Friday over a World Health Organization (WHO) clinical trial which concluded that the anti-viral drug remdesivir has little or no impact on a patient’s chances of surviving COVID-19.Gilead Sciences Inc. GILD.O, the U.S. company that developed the drug, said the findings appeared inconsistent with evidence from other studies validating the clinical benefit of remdesivir, which was used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump's coronavirus infection.“We are concerned the data from this open-label global trial has not undergone the rigorous review required to allow for constructive scientific discussion,” Gilead said.But Richard Peto, an independent statistician hired by the WHO to scrutinize the results of its Solidarity trial, dismissed Gilead’s criticism.“It’s a reliable result, don’t let anybody tell you otherwise, because they’ll try to,” Peto told reporters. “This is real world evidence.”The results of the trial, announced by the WHO on Thursday, dealt a blow to one of the few drugs being used to treat people with COVID-19.The U.N. health agency said remdesivir appeared to have little or no effect on keeping people alive or on the length of hospital stays among patients with the respiratory disease.Its trial was conducted on 11,266 adult patients in over 30 countries and its findings may shift the focus of treatments away from antivirals such as remdesivir to new monoclonal antibodies which the WHO has said could be added to its studies.In addition to remdesivir, Trump received Regeneron's REGN.O experimental monoclonal antibody infection. But another U.S. company, Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N, said on Tuesday a trial of its own COVID-19 antibody treatment had been paused over safety concerns. “FAR FROM WON”Gilead, which quickly repurposed what it had developed as an Ebola drug when the COVID-19 pandemic began, said that other, smaller remdesivir trials showed the treatment cut COVID-19 recovery time by five days and helped reduce the risk of death in some patients who were getting oxygen.Peto, an Oxford University professor emeritus, said the smaller trial’s perceived benefit in keeping people alive could have been mere “chance”.“And you’ve got to randomise in large numbers,” Peto said. “There isn’t sufficient emphasis based on the need for large numbers if you want really reliable results.”For the remdesivir arm of the WHO’s Solidarity trial, 2,743 patients were given remdesivir, compared to 2,708 in the control group. Gilead’s study had 1,062 participants.“The real disappointment is that remdesivir has also failed in a larger number of cases and in the ‘real world setting’,” Clemens Wendtner, Chief Physician of Infectiology and Tropical Medicine at Munich’s Schwabing Clinic, said.“A major clinical breakthrough looks different and warns us that the battle against COVID-19 is far from won.”The WHO’s trial also found that other medicines repurposed since the pandemic began -- malaria drug hydroxychloroquine, anti-HIV drug combination lopinavir/ritonavir and interferon -- offered little or no benefit to COVID-19 patients.The hydroxychloroquine and anti-HIV studies were abandoned earlier this year, and interferon was dropped on Thursday.Guidance on how countries should deploy remdesivir will come in two or three weeks after a data review, WHO officials said.Remdesivir was given emergency use authorization from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration on May 1.The European Union has given remdesivir emergency authorization and agreed to a 1 billion euro ($1.2 billion) remdesivir deal on Tuesday, weeks after Gilead was informed by the WHO about the results of the Solidarity trial.The European Medicines Agency said it would review the trial data “to see if any changes are needed to the way these medicines are used.”Some scientists said Gilead’s complaints merit scrutiny.Differences in patients who participated in the trial at hundreds of clinical sites may undermine the quality of the data, said Prof. Peter Galle, who oversees infectiology at Germany’s Mainz university hospital.But he added: “This provides more evidence that remdesivir is no panacea.”($1 = 0.8535 euros)"
2020-10-19,Evotec secures grant to evaluate antibody drugs for COVID-19,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2HA13V,"BERLIN (Reuters) - German biotech company Evotec EVTG.DE said on Monday it had received a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to help identify and develop potential monoclonal antibody (mAbS) drugs for the prevention of severe COVID-19.Several drugmakers are testing antibody treatments for COVID-19 to help patients’ immune systems fight the coronavirus that causes the disease which has killed more than 1 million people worldwide.Antibody treatments have come into focus after a study showed anti-viral drug remdesivir, one of the few drugs being used to treat people with COVID-19, has little or no impact on a patient’s chances of surviving COVID-19.Evotec said the grant would enable its Seattle-based subsidiary Just to use its software, called Abacus, to analyse several lead candidate sequences of potent mAbs, which have been provided to the foundation by academic medical centres around the world.“Abacus will enable a rapid evaluation of the antibody candidates to potentially improve their quality and deliver the lowest possible costs for development and manufacture,” said James Thomas, global head of biotherapeutics at Just.Evotec did not disclose the size of the grant. It said it would also perform cell line development for two lead molecules.Monoclonal antibodies are laboratory-made versions of proteins naturally produced by the immune system in response to invading viruses or other pathogens.Antibody treatment has also come under the spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump was treated with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals' REGN.O antibody drug earlier this month."
2020-10-27,Eli Lilly strikes optimistic tone on COVID-19 therapy after trial failure,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2HI2U2,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N on Tuesday aimed to ease investor concerns about its COVID-19 antibody treatment after a trial of the therapy failed to show a benefit in hospitalized patients.Lilly said it remains optimistic about ongoing trials for the experimental COVID-19 antibody therapy. The drugmaker also said issues raised by U.S. regulators after an inspection of one of its manufacturing facilities do not effect the quality or safety of the treatment.Reuters reported earlier this month that U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspectors found serious quality control problems at the plant preparing to manufacture the antibody therapies.The company said it remains confident in the ability of the single antibody treatment to prevent progression of disease for those earlier in the course of COVID-19.“While the results in hospitalized patients were disappointing, we don’t expect this to affect our chances of success in prophylaxis (prevention) or in early treatment,” Chief Scientific Officer Daniel Skovronsky said on a conference call.Lilly said it intends to request emergency use authorization (EUA) from the FDA for its dual antibody therapy as soon as November. It has already applied for an EUA for the single antibody treatment for use in mild to moderate COVID-19 patients and for its arthritis drug baricitinib.U.S. President Donald Trump has been touting the antibody therapies after receiving a similar treatment from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O during his own recent bout with COVID-19.The Indianapolis-based drugmaker also reported a lower-than-expected quarterly profit in part due to pricing pressure on some of its major drugs, including diabetes treatment Trulicity, and its shares fell more than 5%.Third-quarter earnings of $1.54 per share missed analysts’ average estimate of $1.71, according to IBES estimates from Refinitiv.The company pointed to higher rebates to insurers to ensure Trulicity’s market share and a larger portion of sales coming from the U.S. Medicaid program, which pays less than commercial insurers for the medicine. But Lilly maintained its earnings forecast for the full year.Trulicity sales of $1.11 billion for the quarter was below the Wall Street consensus estimate of $1.27 billion, according to brokerage Mizuho.Lilly said it expects 2020 COVID-19 research and development expense to be roughly $400 million.Revenue rose 5% to $5.74 billion in the quarter, below analyst forecasts of $5.88 billion.Lilly said it still anticipates 2020 revenue of $23.7 billion to $24.2 billion.It cautioned that achieving the higher end of the range would likely require moderate revenue from potential COVID-19 treatments."

The drug had a recent setback after it failed to show benefits in hospitalized patients.In addition, Reuters reported that U.S. drug inspectors uncovered serious quality control problems at an Eli Lilly plant that is ramping up to make its antibody therapy.The antibody therapy is similar to a drug from Regeneron that was given to Trump during his bout with COVID-19.The treatments belong to a class of drugs called monoclonal antibodies that are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the body to fight against an infection."

The new data confirm the initial findings, the company said.Regeneron’s drug is a cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies - manufactured copies of antibodies that are one of the main weapons the immune system generates to fight infections.Trump has credited the Regeneron therapy for his recovery from COVID-19 and said he would push for emergency use authorization (EUA) of that treatment and others like it. He also said he wanted it to be provided at no cost to Americans.The company earlier this month filed with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration seeking an EUA for the dual-antibody therapy. It said it has shared the new data with the regulator as part of the review of its request.Eli Lilly and Co makes a similar drug and also filed for an EUA. The company signed a $375 million contract to provide 300,000 doses of its treatment to the U.S. government on WednesdayRegeneron said earlier this month it had around 50,000 doses of its treatment ready for distribution.The U.S. government agreed in June to buy up to 300,000 doses of the antibody cocktail for $450 million."

Rival Eli Lilly & Co stopped enrolling such patients based on a similar suggestion earlier this week.“It appears a trend is emerging in the class, and it may be that neutralizing antibodies simply do not work and/or are not safe in this (hospitalized) population,” JP Morgan analyst Cory Kasimov said in a note.Both treatments belong to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies. Regeneron’s drug, which was administered to U.S. President Donald Trump before he was hospitalized, was credited by him for his recovery from COVID-19.Regeneron continues to enroll other types of patients for trials and its enrollment in non-hospitalized patients as well as hospitalized patients requiring either no or a low level of oxygen has been backed by the independent data monitoring committee.The treatment lowers virus loads in some non-hospitalized patients, the drugmaker said on Wednesday. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is evaluating the treatment for a potential emergency use authorization (EUA) in mild-to-moderate patients at high risk for poor outcome.Regeneron said it will inform the health regulator about the latest move. President Trump had earlier said he would push for an EUA status for it and make it free to Americans. JP Morgan’s Kasimov said he still expects the treatment to get the tag.The antibody cocktail is being studied in four late-stage clinical studies, including the Recovery trial in the UK.Regeneron shares were down nearly 3% at $540.87."

Operations are expected to start in the first half of 2021.The U.S. government this month awarded $486 million to AstraZeneca to develop and secure supplies of up to 100,000 doses of the experimental treatment.AstraZeneca declined to disclose volumes or other terms of the Lonza contract, but a spokesman said Lonza would be part a global supply chain.He added AstraZeneca would likely make more announcements on supplies in future, potentially involving its own sites or external partners.AZD7442 is in Phase I clinical studies and AstraZeneca said on Oct. 9 it planned to advance it into final Phase III trials in the coming weeks.AstraZeneca’s agreement under the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed programme is to develop a monoclonal antibody cocktail especially for high-risk people, such as those over 80 years old.Targeted antibodies made by biotech firm Regeneron were used to treat President Donald Trump’s COVID-19 infection. The company signed a $450 million U.S. government deal in July to sell doses for the treatment of around 300,000 people.

But we don’t know the timeline,” Regeneron Chief Executive Officer Leonard Schleifer said during a conference call to discuss the company’s earnings.The company has said that clinical trial data shows the drug reduced medical visits in patients with mild-to-moderate cases. The antibody treatment would be the first drug designed specifically to fight COVID-19 and could become a tool in the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than one million people globally.Based on clinical trials, Regeneron expects emergency use authorization could be granted for outpatients, a group that it believes would benefit the most from the drug.About 80,000 doses of the treatment could be ready by the end of this month, and 300,000 doses by the end of January, Regeneron said.The company has been working to scale up production of the drug, and raised its forecast for 2020 research and development expenses to between $2.75 billion and $2.82 billion, from its prior forecast of $2.61 billion and $2.73 billion. It would also result in higher expenses in the first half of 2021.The company said last week that COVID-19 patients receiving advanced care in the hospital are no longer being enrolled in clinical trials after a data panel signaled a potential safety signal and an unfavorable risk-benefit profile.“I think theoretically, there is not really a great deal of rationale why there might be a safety signal,” said George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s chief scientific officer.On Thursday, a data committee for large UK trial that is testing several potential drugs for COVID-19, including Regeneron’s REGN-COV2, said the trial should continue enrolling all patients, including severe patients.The committee said that its decision was prompted by data from over 15,000 patients, and available external information.

U.S. President Donald Trump got their antibodies in October after testing COVID-19 positive.Eli Lilly has already agreed to produce antibodies at the Fujifilm plant from April and make them available at “an affordable price” to poorer countries, a company spokeswoman said.A U.S. government-run trial of Lilly’s drug was paused in mid-October over safety concerns, but other trials continue and the U.S. administration last week sealed a $375-million supply deal.It is unclear how and whether the WHO scheme will raise the money needed for the antibody project.Roche, which has partnered with Regeneron to make up to 2 million doses of the so-called REGN-COV2 antibody annually by 2021, has had “preliminary discussions” with the ACT Accelerator over an access plan.“These discussions were in the context of development and production,” a Roche spokesman said in an email. “It is too early to speculate on future decisions, but we will continue working with them and other groups regarding REGN-COV2.”Novartis, which expects results soon from a trial of its arthritis treatment canakinumab against COVID-19, said on Thursday it received a request several days ago from the WHO scheme seeking information about medicines to tackle the coronavirus. Novartis also makes dexamethasone.Despite being short of funds, the WHO drugs-supply scheme aims to distribute hundreds of millions of courses of COVID-19 drugs to poorer countries by 2022.Apart from monoclonal antibodies and dexamethasone, it is also eyeing other experimental drugs, including new antivirals and repurposed drugs.The scheme would spend another $100 million to seal deals with unspecified drugmakers from mid-2021, the document says, and next year plans to invest another $4.4 billion on drugs that succeed in clinical trials.The Unitaid spokeswoman said dexamethasone and its alternative, hydrocortisone, were the most promising among repurposed drugs.Unitaid confirmed the scheme had not procured or funded remdesivir, which was initially trialled against Ebola. It did not comment on why remdesivir did not appear among priority treatments in the document.Remdesivir has been authorised in multiple countries to treat COVID-19. However, preliminary findings of a WHO-sponsored trial conluded the antiviral had little or no benefit, contradicting previous positive trials.Governments however continue to buy it, with Germany this week announcing a 150,000-plus dose purchase.."

2020-11-06,Humanigen inks COVID-19 drug development agreement with U.S. defense department,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2HS3D3,"(Reuters) - Humanigen Inc has partnered with the U.S. government to help advance development of its drug candidate as a potential COVID-19 treatment following positive response in hospitalized patients in a late-stage study, the company said on Friday.Patients receiving the drug, lenzilumab, saw 37% more recovery as compared to current standard of care in the study reut.rs/2U0IPRi, which aims to determine whether the drug can prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called ""cytokine storm"".The tie-up with the defense department is part of the U.S. government’s Operation Warp Speed, which has struck deals with several other drugmakers to help speed up the development of a possible COVID-19 treatment.Humanigen’s shares rose 13% in premarket trading after the company said it plans to file for an emergency use approval (EUA) in the first quarter of 2021, either following interim data at 75% or at study completion.Lenzilumab has been selected by the National Institutes of Health to be evaluated alongside Gilead Sciences’ COVID-19 drug candidate, remdesivir, which received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s approval for treating patients hospitalized with COVID-19.Lenzilumab belongs to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, similar to the ones being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Eli Lilly for COVID-19. Treatments from Lilly and Regeneron are being considered by the health regulator for EUAs.Following the recommendation of an independent safety board, Humanigen plans to increase enrollment to the study to ensure higher probability of meeting the main goal.The next interim data analysis is planned for when the study enrolls about 390 patients, the company said.The agreement, which is in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, will support an ongoing late-stage trial of lenzilumab.Financial terms of the deal were not disclosed.(refini.tv/3jZtFpX)"
2020-11-06,Aspirin to be tested as potential COVID-19 drug in UK study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27M1C2,"(Reuters) - Painkiller aspirin will be evaluated as a possible treatment for COVID-19 in one of Britain’s biggest trials, which will assess whether it might reduce the risk of blood clots in people with the disease.The scientists behind the RECOVERY trial, which is looking into a range of potential treatments for COVID-19, said it would include the drug, which is commonly used as a blood thinner.“There is a clear rationale for believing that it (aspirin) might be beneficial, and it is safe, inexpensive and widely available,” said Peter Horby, co-chief investigator of the trial.Patients infected with the coronavirus are at a higher risk of blood clots because of hyper-reactive platelets, the cell fragments that help stop bleeding. Aspirin is an antiplatelet agent and can reduce the risk of clots, the RECOVERY trial’s website said on Friday.At least 2,000 patients are expected to randomly get 150 mg of aspirin daily along with the usual regimen. Data from those patients will be compared with at least 2,000 other patients who receive the standard COVID-19 treatment on its own, the website showed.Small daily doses of aspirin has been found to reduce the risk of certain cancers. As a blood thinner, it increases the risk of internal bleeding, and taking too much over a long period of time has been associated with kidney damage.Other treatments being tested in the RECOVERY trial include common antibiotic azithromycin and Regeneron’s antibody cocktail that was used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump’s COVID-19 symptoms.Unlike Gilead’s remdesivir, which has been approved as a COVID-19 treatment in the United States but has shown poor results in a large World Health Organization trial, aspirin is a generic drug, making it much cheaper.The RECOVERY trial was the first to show that dexamethasone, a steroid which is also cheap and widely available, could save lives of people severely ill with COVID-19.It also showed that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, once touted by Trump, was of no benefit in treating COVID-19 patients."
2020-11-09,U.S. allows emergency use of first COVID-19 antibody drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27P35L,"(Reuters) - U.S. regulators on Monday authorized emergency use of the first experimental antibody drug for COVID-19 in patients who are not hospitalized but are at risk of serious illness because of their age or other conditions.The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted emergency use authorization (EUA) to Eli Lilly & Co’s bamlanivimab based on trial data showing that a one-time infusion of the treatment reduced the need for hospitalization or emergency room visits in high-risk COVID-19 patients.The drug is a monoclonal antibody – a widely used class of biotech drugs which in this case is a manufactured copy of an antibody the human body creates to fight infections.A similar treatment developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc was given to U.S. President Donald Trump after he caught the coronavirus in early October. The nation’s top infectious disease expert Dr. Anthony Fauci said it likely contributed to Trump’s recovery.The White House, in an emailed statement, hailed the FDA’s decision as “a major milestone.”Regeneron is also seeking an EUA for its dual-antibody against COVID-19.The FDA said Lilly’s antibody can be used for anyone over the age of 65 who is recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and for patients age 12 and older who have an underlying health condition putting them at risk for serious illness.It was not authorized for hospitalized patients nor for those who required oxygen therapy due to COVID-19 as it could worsen clinical outcomes for such patients. A U.S. government-sponsored study of bamlanivimab in hospitalized COVID-19 patients was recently abandoned because the treatment was not shown to be helping.Lilly said it will begin shipping bamlanivimab immediately through distributor AmerisourceBergen, but regional allocations of the drug will be determined by the federal government.The U.S. government has purchased 300,000 doses of the treatment and committed that Americans will have no out-of-pocket costs for the medicine, although healthcare facilities may charge a fee for the product’s administration.Lilly anticipates manufacturing up to one million doses of bamlanivimab by the end of 2020, for use around the world through early next year. Beginning in first-quarter 2021, it expects the supply to increase substantially, as additional manufacturing resources come online.Under the EUA, the FDA said Lilly will retain an independent third party to conduct a review of records and underlying data and associated discrepancies of bamlanivimab drug substance manufactured at the company’s Branchburg, New Jersey plant.Reuters on Oct. 13 reported that inspectors who visited the Branchburg plant in November 2019 found data on various manufacturing processes had been deleted and not appropriately audited, according to government inspection documents.Lilly has said it plans to pursue a similar authorization in November for its two-antibody cocktail, which it described as having helped reduce viral levels even more than the single-antibody treatment.Shares of the Indianapolis drugmaker, which closed little changed at $142.33 in regular trading, were up 3.6% after hours."
2020-11-10,"Amgen, AstraZeneca say experimental asthma drug meets trial goal",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27Q3BA,"(Reuters) - Drugmakers Amgen Inc and AstraZeneca Plc said on Tuesday a pivotal trial found that their experimental medication tezepelumab significantly reduced asthma attacks for people with severe forms of the respiratory condition compared to a placebo.The partners said that the year-long trial met its primary goal in patients with severe asthma who were also receiving standard care, including medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids plus at least one other controller medication.The drug was also shown to work in a subgroup of patients with low levels of a type of white blood cell, called eosinophil, associated with swelling and narrowing of airways, the drugmakers said in a press release.“The key thing is that tezepelumab also seems to work in the low eosinophil patient group, which could help it differentiate from Regeneron’s Dupixent and AstraZeneca’s Fasenra, both of which are indicated for the ‘eosinphilic phenotype’,” Mizuho analyst Salim Syed said in a research note, referring to currently available asthma drugs.The drugmakers said tezepelumab was well tolerated by trial patients, with no big differences in safety results compared to the placebo.Full results from the trial will be presented at an upcoming medical meeting, Amgen said in a statement.Shares of Amgen rose $6.60, or 2.8%, to close at $241.60 on Tuesday, while shares of AstraZeneca rose $2.52, or 4.7%, to close at $56.57."

The company does not make vaccines but does have a manufacturing deal with Regeneron to make its experimental COVID-19 antibody treatment.Poll results released in October by the partly European Union-funded Vaccine Confidence Project (VCP), a global surveillance programme, showed such a vaccine mandate could have a chilling effect on people’s willingness to get a shot.All respondents said they would be less likely to accept a COVID-19 vaccine if it were mandated by employers, the poll showed.On Wednesday, a World Health Organization official stopped short of answering a question about whether a COVID-19 vaccine should be mandatory for children, before they are allowed to go to school.“We really need to see what they (vaccines) do in adults, and then look carefully at how to move into children,” said Kate O’Brien, who heads up the Immunization, Vaccines and Biologicals department at the WHO, during a social media event.O’Brien said it first must be determined if a vaccine can not only prevent infections or death, but also halt transmission of the virus to another person. “If they’re going to be used in kids, what we’re really also concerned about, and want to know about, is whether or not that transmission protection is something that could really benefit children,” she said."

2020-11-14,Novartis identifies possible risk factors for Beovu patients,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2I004K,"ZURICH, Nov 14 (Reuters) - Patients who had certain eye problems before they were treated with Novartis’s Beovu had a higher risk of suffering from vision-threatening conditions after treatment, the Swiss drugmaker said on Saturday, based on a safety review.The review follows a warning issued by the American Society of Retinal Specialists in February about instances of intraocular inflammation, some of which led to severe vision loss, in patients using Beovu.The drug, which Novartis touts as a potential $1-billon-dollar-plus product annually, was approved last year for treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration (AMD), though it has trailed sales expectations in part due to the safety concerns.According to Novartis’s review, among 12,000 patients treated with Beovu, the highest observed risk for experiencing retinal vasculitis and/or retinal vascular occlusion in the six months after first treatment was prior intraocular inflammation and/or vascular occlusion in the 12 months before the first Beovu injection.The observed overall risk rate of 0.46% for all Beovu-treated patients increased to 3.97% in people who had the conditions before treatment, Novartis said.Global regulators have approved updated safety guidelines for using Beovu, as Novartis’s review aims at identifying ways to prevent cases where severe vision loss occurs.“Novartis is confident that Beovu continues to represent an important treatment option for patients with wet AMD, with an overall favorable benefit/risk profile,” the Basel-based company said.As the population ages and suffers eye problems, the market to treat AMD is among the medical industry’s most competitive, with drugs including Lucentis -- sold by Roche in the United States and Novartis in Europe -- and Regeneron’s Eylea racking up billions of dollars in sales.New products are in the works, as well, including drugs as well as innovations aiming to reduce the number of yearly injections direct into the eye."

It expects supply to increase substantially from the first quarter of 2021 as additional manufacturing resources come online.Samsung said it has a long-term manufacturing contract with Lilly. It did not disclose details.The South Korean firm said it initially struggled to secure raw materials due to tight supplies. It expedited the technology transfer process, allowing it to begin shipments to Lilly five months after agreeing a production deal in May.The drug is a monoclonal antibody - a widely used class of biotech drugs which in this case is a manufactured copy of an antibody the human body creates to fight infection.Other potential antibody treatments being developed for COVID-19 patients include one by U.S. drugmaker Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which U.S. President Donald Trump received after his diagnosis last month."
2020-11-17,Regeneron says Roche successfully tested manufacture of COVID-19 drug used on Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27X2T5,"(Reuters) - Roche Holding AG has completed early tests of its ability to produce large quantities of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s COVID-19 antibody treatment, putting it on track to begin manufacturing the drug once it is authorized by regulators, Regeneron’s president said on Tuesday.The experimental therapy was used to treat U.S. President Donald Trump in October. The companies aim to be able to make 2 million doses of the antibody cocktail next year, but are awaiting clearance from regulators.Roche “has already started engineering runs at scale and (has) been successful,” Regeneron President and Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said in an interview ahead of this week’s Reuters Total Health conference.A Roche spokesman said the Swiss drugmaker would be ready to begin producing the treatment in the first quarter of 2021.Regeneron has had discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration almost every day since it submitted its application for emergency use of the COVID-19 drug in October, and expects a final decision in the “very near future,” Yancopoulos, a co-founder of the U.S. biotech company said.Regeneron hopes to apply for full approval of the drug shortly afterwards, he said, echoing his comment during Regeneron’s investor call earlier this month.The company has a contract to provide 300,000 doses of the antibody therapy, called REGN-COV2, to the U.S. government and expects to be able to meet that commitment by as early as January. It has more than 50,000 doses currently stockpiled.The 2 million doses Regeneron expects to be able to produce in partnership with Roche next year may not be enough to treat all the patients worldwide who could benefit from it, Yancopoulos said, based on the rate at which the virus is again spreading and sickening people globally.He added that Regeneron is in talks with U.S. officials about providing more doses than it has already agreed to, but has not reached any conclusive agreement. Regeneron’s current contract with the U.S. government priced 300,000 doses at $450 million.Regeneron has been speaking regularly with U.S. President-elect Joe Biden’s COVID-19 task force and has shown them a presentation on the antibody treatment, Yancopoulos said.After Trump received the Regeneron treatment along with several other medicines during his bout with COVID-19, he touted it as a virtual “cure” for the illness, promising to make it free for Americans.For more on Reuters Events Total Health click here: here."
2020-11-17,U.S. hospitals to restrict Lilly COVID-19 antibody treatment due to limited supply,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN27X1EU,"(Reuters) - U.S. hospitals, weighing high demand and tight supplies, said they may limit use of a new Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N antibody drug to COVID-19 patients with multiple risk factors for serious illness or to those whose immune systems have not begun to fight the infection. The treatment, bamlanivimab, was given U.S. emergency use authorization (EUA) last week by the Food and Drug Administration for helping newly-diagnosed, high-risk patients avoid hospitalization.“There will be a lot of pressure on physicians,” said Dr. Adarsh Bhimraj, an infectious disease specialist at the Cleveland Clinic and chair of the Infectious Diseases Society of America’s guidelines panel, which is still discussing its recommendations for the drug.President Donald Trump has touted experimental antibody drugs after being treated with a similar therapy from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O during his own bout with COVID-19.The federal government has paid $1,250 per dose for 300,000 doses of bamlanivimab, which experts estimate may only be enough for one weeks’ worth of Americans becoming infected, based on the FDA label identifying appropriate patients.The United States on Sunday crossed 11 million total coronavirus infections just a little over a week after hitting the 10 million mark since the pandemic began. Medical groups and hospitals said they are working to establish criteria for which patients are likely to benefit most from the drug, which consists of manufactured copies of an antibody made by the human body to fight COVID-19. “Otherwise, we will be out of drug real soon,” said Dr. Howard Huang, a lung specialist at Houston Methodist.The FDA authorized bamlanivimab for patients over age 65 recently diagnosed with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 and patients with obesity, diabetes, or another risk factor. The agency said the drug should not be used in hospitalized patients.“There may need to be some sort of composite score” to select patients, Huang said. “Maybe we would use it for someone who has cardiovascular disease, and a history of stroke and is older?”Dr. Neha Nanda, medical director of infection prevention with Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles said “more conservative criteria” is needed. “One group you could exclude is someone who has an antibody test that is positive,” she said. “I think we may need to do that.”Regeneron has said its experimental COVID-19 antibody cocktail has shown the most benefit in patients who had not mounted their own immune response prior to treatment. The company is also seeking an EUA.Despite the FDA’s clearance of Lilly’s drug - based on published findings from a small mid-stage study - experts said they would like to see more clinical trial data.The drug, given as a one-time infusion, is initially being distributed only to hospitals. Some were already set up to treat trial patients, while others said they are working on logistics.The United States has the option to buy another 650,000 doses, but hospitals expect the drug will eventually become a commercial product.Eli Lilly officials did not respond to requests for comment on pricing plans."
2020-11-21,U.S. FDA grants emergency use authorization to Regeneron COVID-19 antibody given to Trump,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2I8010,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration on Saturday issued emergency use authorization for Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s COVID-19 antibody therapy, an experimental treatment given to U.S. President Donald Trump that he said helped cure him of the disease.The FDA said the monoclonal antibodies, casirivimab and imdevimab, should be administered together for the treatment of mild to moderate COVID-19 in adults and pediatric patients with positive results of direct SARS-CoV-2 viral testing and who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19. bit.ly/3kTd6fRThis includes those who are 65 years of age or older or who have certain chronic medical conditions.The treatment is part of a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the human body to fight infections.Regeneron’s REGEN-COV2 “antibody cocktail” - containing an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that the two antibodies seek out and bind to the coronavirus’ spike protein to prevent it from entering healthy human cells.Regeneron said on Saturday the clinical evidence from outpatient trial suggests that monoclonal antibodies such as REGEN-COV2 have the greatest benefit when given early after diagnosis and in patients who have not yet mounted their own immune response or who have high viral load.The company said it expects to have does of REGEN-COV2 treatment ready for about 80,000 patients by the end of this month, about 200,000 patients by the first week of January and approximately 300,000 patients in total by the end of January.The FDA said the antibodies are not authorized for patients who are hospitalized due to COVID-19 or require oxygen therapy due to COVID-19."

It expects to have enough doses to treat about 200,000 patients by the first week of January, rising to some 300,000 patients in total by the end of January.The antibody cocktail was among the treatments given to U.S. President Trump during his bout with COVID-19 last month. He declared it a virtual “cure” for COVID-19 at the time.The treatment belongs to a class of biotech drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are manufactured copies of antibodies created by the human body to fight infections.U.S. regulators earlier this month authorized another antibody treatment for COVID-19 from Eli Lilly and Co. Officials on Monday said the department of Health and Human Services has already helped distribute 120,000 doses of Lilly’s antibody to patients around the country.More than 250,000 Americans have also been treated for their COVID-19 with antibody-rich convalescent plasma from recovered patients, officials said. Some health experts have argued that there is not enough data to show that convalescent plasma is an effective treatment."

2020-11-24,\'COVID chat\': Officials urge Americans to stay home over holiday,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN28427B,"(Reuters) - U.S. health officials and politicians pleaded with Americans on Tuesday to stay at home over the Thanksgiving holiday and abide by constraints placed on social and economic life as record coronavirus caseloads pushed hospitals to their limits.The chorus of public appeals intensified heading into a holiday weekend expected to further fuel an alarming surge of infections nationwide, while the daily U.S. death toll climbed above 2,000 - at least four deaths every three minutes. It marked the highest 24-hour loss of life from the pandemic since early May.“We are on fire with COVID,” Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear said on CNN, defending unpopular restrictions he ordered last week that included new limits on retail activity and school closures. “We’re just trying to do the right thing.”More than half the nation’s governors have imposed - or reimposed - statewide measures this month to slow the contagion, ranging from tougher face-mask requirements and social curfews to stringent new limits on restaurants, bars and other businesses. Yet the metrics of the virus have only worsened.The number of patients being treated for coronavirus infections in U.S. hospitals surpassed 87,000 on Tuesday, an all-time high, while 30 of the 50 states reported a record number of COVID-19-related hospitalizations this month.The soaring caseload has taxed already exhausted healthcare providers and further strained medical resources as 171,000 Americans test positive and 1,500 or more perish from COVID-19 every day, on average.U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams urged the public to grasp “the severity of the moment” and remain diligent in wearing face coverings, avoiding crowds and washing hands until newly developed therapeutic treatments and vaccines can be made widely available in the months ahead.“We just need you, the American people, to hold on a little bit longer,” Adams told Fox News in an interview. He joined other health authorities on Tuesday to advise against holiday travel, and called for families to limit their traditional Thanksgiving celebrations on Thursday to small gatherings of immediate household members.HOW TO JUST SAY ‘NO’California’s top health official, Dr. Mark Ghaly, went so far in his weekly public COVID briefing on Tuesday as to offer up “COVID chat” talking points for politely but firmly declining invitations to family gatherings that might be unsafe.“Saying ‘no’ to people you love is never easy ... but knowing how and when to say ‘no’ is the first step to protecting your health and the health of the people you care about,” Ghaly wrote.Government data and projections from the American Automobile Association show such pleas are being widely disregarded.Although fewer in number than is typical, millions of Americans have flocked to airports and highways in recent days, leading to the busiest U.S. travel period since the early days of the pandemic in March.One travel complication may soon be relaxed, as the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention considers shortening its recommended 14-day quarantine after potential exposure to the virus for individuals who test negative during their isolation.Health authorities also said this week they expected the first vaccines to win U.S. regulatory approval for distribution next month and begin to be administered to frontline healthcare workers and other high-priority individuals by mid-December. But the shots are unlikely to become widely available to the general public on demand before April or May, experts have said.In the meantime, doctors will soon have additional medical treatments for COVID-19 at their disposal.A newly authorized antibody combination therapy from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc was due to begin U.S. government distribution on Tuesday.The state of Texas opened an outpatient facility to provide infusions of the experimental antibody drug bamlanivimab to COVID-positive individuals at an alternative-care site in El Paso, a city especially hard hit by the virus.After initially clobbering major U.S. metropolitan areas during the spring, the COVID-19 pandemic has since engulfed rural and small-town America.Infection rates in a dozen Midwestern states have more than doubled those of any other region, according to the COVID Tracking Project, soaring 20 times higher from mid-June to mid-November.Many Midwestern hospitals have reported shortages of beds, equipment and clinical staff, with some of the most dire scenarios playing out in areas where the public has been most resistant to wearing masks and practicing social distancing.“There’s a disconnect in the community, where we’re seeing people at bars and restaurants, or planning Thanksgiving dinners,” said Dr. Kelly Cawcutt, an infectious disease physician at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.

2020-12-14,Trial of azithromycin in severe COVID-19 patients finds no benefit,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN28O1RG,"LONDON (Reuters) - A clinical trial of the widely-used antibiotic azithromycin in COVID-19 patients in hospital has found no convincing evidence of benefit, prompting doctors to announce on Monday that they have closed that section of the trial.“Our results show very clearly that for patients hospitalised with COVID-19, azithromycin is not an effective treatment,” said Peter Horby, a co-lead investigator on the UK RECOVERY trial, which is exploring a range of existing drugs for their potential to treat the pandemic disease.He said that while results for azithromycin were “disappointing”, they would provide guidance for doctors around the world caring for patients infected with the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.The RECOVERY trial was the first to show that dexamethasone, a steroid that, like azithromycin, is cheap and widely available, could save the lives of people severely ill with COVID-19.It also showed that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, once touted by U.S. President Donald Trump, was of no benefit in treating COVID-19 patients.In the azithromycin arm of the trial, 2,582 patients were randomised to azithromycin and compared with 5,182 patients who were randomly assigned to usual care alone.A preliminary analysis showed no significant difference in death rates after 28 days, which were 19% in both groups.There was also no evidence of beneficial effects on the risk of patients needing mechanical ventilation or on how long they needed to be in hospital. The data have yet to be peer reviewed, but were published on Monday (bit.ly/3gMFcsM) on the medRxiv website.Given the lack of benefit, experts on the steering committee overseeing the trial agreed it should be closed on Nov. 27, Horby said in a statement.Since the trial only included hospitalised COVID-19 patients, he said it could not offer any conclusions about the effectiveness of azithromycin in treating people with COVID-19 whose illness is less severe.The RECOVERY trial will continue to assess several other potential COVID-19 treatments, he said, including convalescent plasma and an antibody cocktail made by Regeneron.“Further results are likely over the next couple of months,” Horby said."

He cited a minor glitch involving four trays of vaccine - two sent to California and two to Alabama - that arrived at temperatures lower than prescribed. The trays in question were shipped back to Pfizer and later replaced, Perna said.Some 570 other vaccine distribution centers received the bulk of the initial batch of shipments on Monday and Tuesday, and an even larger wave was due for delivery to 886 additional locations on Friday, Perna said.From each distribution site, vaccine doses were divided up among area hospitals and administered to healthcare workers, designated as first in line to be immunized. Some were also going to residents and staff of long-term care facilities. Later vaccine rounds will go to other essential workers, senior citizens and people with chronic health conditions.U.S. President-elect Joe Biden, who has said he would get the vaccine publicly to help instill confidence in its safety, is expected to receive his first injection as soon as next week, according to his transition team.Biden, 78, is in a high-risk category for the coronavirus due to his age.‘NOT OVER YET’It will take several months before vaccines are widely available to the public on demand, and opinion polls have found many Americans hesitant about getting inoculated.Political leaders and medical authorities in the meantime have launched a media blitz assuring Americans that the vaccines are safe while urging them to avoid growing weary of social distancing and mask-wearing while the pandemic rages on.“It is not over yet,” Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House coronavirus task force, told CBS News. “Public health measures are the bridge to get to the vaccine, which is going to get us out of this.”Data shows surging infections and hospitalizations are driving healthcare systems to the breaking point across much of the country, with many intensive care units at or near capacity.The United States reported at least 3,459 additional coronavirus deaths on Wednesday alone, a record that marks the fourth time in a week the daily toll has surpassed 3,000, according to a Reuters tally.

Both require two doses, given three or four weeks apart, for each person inoculated.In all, the United States has options to buy up to 300 million doses of those vaccines, Azar said, plus hundreds of millions more doses of vaccines yet to receive approval, including some single-dose drugs.The United States could have a surplus supply of vaccines in the future, if all the vaccines it has secured are authorized for use, Azar said, which could eventually benefit other countries.The Trump administration was also in talks to secure additional antibody treatment doses from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Eli Lilly and Co, Operation Warp Speed chief adviser Moncef Slaoui told the same conference call."

Regeneron's cocktail contains an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19.Gamaleya's Gintsburg said on Sunday that the new Russian drug would be made up of ""monoclonal antibodies"", genetically engineered versions of the antibodies that are found in the blood plasma of those who have been sick with COVID-19, the TASS news agency reported. Russia last week stopped taking in new volunteers for its main human trial of Sputnik V, with developers saying it was unethical to administer a placebo to participants now that the shot was increasingly available to the public.  read more Russia began inoculating small numbers of people in high-risk groups soon after it granted regulatory approval to the vaccine in August. It launched its large-scale, final-stage trial in Moscow the following month.

2020-12-31,"CORRECTED-COVID SCIENCE-UK variant linked to high viral loads, Neanderthal gene offers protection",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2J81AI,"Dec 28 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.UK coronavirus variant associated with higher viral loadsThe highly infectious COVID-19 coronavirus variant that has been circulating in Britain is linked to higher loads of the virus in swab samples obtained from the nose and the back of the throat, according to a research report published on medRxiv on Sunday ahead of peer review. Around 35% of patients infected by the variant form had very high levels of the virus in their samples, compared to 10% of patients without the variant, study leader Michael Kidd of Public Health England and Birmingham University told Reuters. Higher viral loads have been linked with worse COVID-19 outcomes. The tests were conducted at the Birmingham Turnkey Lab. Kidd said additional study was needed to confirm or refute the findings. If confirmed, he hopes scientists will investigate how this particular variant manages to make more copies of itself in infected patients. (https://bit.ly/3nUEJrr)Neanderthal gene protects against COVID-19A specific form of a protein passed down from Neanderthals protects against severe COVID-19, and medications that boost  levels of this protein could potentially help treat the disease, according to a study reported on medRxiv on Thursday ahead of peer review. The protein, called OAS1, is involved in the body's response to viruses. People with higher levels of the Neanderthal-related form of OAS1 are less susceptible to COVID-19, and if they do become infected, they are at lower risk for hospitalization, intubation and death, the researchers found. ""This protective form of OAS1 is present in sub-Saharan Africans but was lost when the ancestors of modern-day Europeans migrated out of Africa. It was then re-introduced into the European population through mating with Neanderthals"" who lived more than 40,000 years ago, said coauthor Brent Richards from the Jewish General Hospital and McGill University in Montreal. An earlier study linked a cluster of genes inherited from Neanderthals to higher risks of hospitalization from COVID-19. ""These findings further implicate Neanderthal ancestry in COVID-19 severity,"" Richards said. (https://bit.ly/2KxrQVP)Early antibody production key to COVID-19 recoveryThe speed of patients' antibody production - rather than the volume of antibodies they produce to fight the new coronavirus - determines whether they will survive COVID-19, new data suggest. Researchers who studied more than 200 COVID-19 patients, including 179 who were hospitalized, found those who produced so-called neutralizing antibodies within 14 days of developing symptoms eventually recovered, while those who did not produce neutralizing antibodies until more than 14 days had elapsed developed higher viral loads and more severe disease. ""It is unclear why antibodies generated after this time point are unable to promote viral clearance and recovery in COVID-19 patients,"" the researchers said in a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Study leader Akiko Iwasaki of the Yale University School of Medicine tweeted on Saturday, ""It's possible that virus somehow becomes resistant by hiding in inaccessible tissues."" The new findings, she added, suggest therapy with so-called monoclonal antibody drugs - such as those from Regeneron (REGN.O) given to U.S. President Donald Trump -- is likely to work only if used soon after infection.

2020-2-05,Coronavirus-related risk low for U.S. life and health insurers,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN1ZZ2TZ,"New York(Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The U.S. insurance industry is closely watching the spread of the coronavirus 2019-nCoV in China but it is too early to tell if its occurrence in the U.S. mainland will evolve into a major risk for domestic life and health insurers, experts said.The Trump administration has declared the coronavirus outbreak as a public health emergency and has implemented precautionary measures to contain its spread{here}.The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) made the announcement about the deadly virus a day after the World Health Organisation declared the outbreak a “Pandemic Health Emergency of International Concern” on Jan 30. The HHS is now making more than $250 million available in emergency funds to cover the cost of the response.Although health insurers normally incorporate mortality risk associated with seasonal influenza into their premium rates, they do not typically incorporate an expectation for epidemics or pandemics.Rating agency Fitch said it does not currently anticipate the arrival of 2019-nCoV in the United States to significantly affect the credit profile of the domestic health insurance sector. Such an outcome would be similar to that of the last two pandemics - the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).Both SARS, in 2003, and MERS, in 2012, which together resulted in over 1,500 deaths worldwide and had infected over 10,000 people globally, had minimal spread and no fatalities in the United States where the disease was met with containment efforts by public health officials.There have been 11 confirmed cases of people carrying the 2019-nCoV in the United States, while 82 more people remain under investigation as of Feb. 3, according to the CDC{here}. More cases of human transmission are expected to surface over the next few days but all those affected are being quarantined and treated.Little detail is now available on the cost of treating the illness and the severity of associated symptoms. Fitch said it will closely monitor the progress of 2019-nCoV, given its rapid transmission.Life insurers with a mortality focus would be at greatest risk if the spread accelerates, Fitch said in a separate note.“To-date, 2019-nCoV has not caused any deaths in the U.S. However, any event that might cause an increase in the U.S. mortality rate has the potential to be a negative credit event for U.S. life insurers in a severe scenario,” Donald Thorpe, Senior Director of Insurance Ratings, said in the note.The American Council of Life Insurers maintained that the industry’s capital reserves will help it cope with a potential health crisis with large volumes of claims. Assets of U.S. life insurers were $7 trillion in 2018, down 2.7 percent from the year before.“How far the coronavirus outbreak will reach remains unknown, but life insurers are prepared to meet their commitments to policyholders,” council spokesman Whit Cornman said.The HHS has partnered with a New York-based biotech company, Regeneron to develop a treatment.

2020-2-06,Drugmaker Sanofi expects further profit growth from narrowed focus,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2000M8,"PARIS (Reuters) - French drugmaker Sanofi SASY.PA on Thursday forecast further profit growth for 2020 even as it drops some research in areas such as diabetes in a shake-up to narrow its focus on blockbuster treatments including eczema medicine Dupixent. Sanofi, long viewed as a laggard in the pharmaceutical sector, has changed its chief executive, its chief financial officer and head of research over the past two years and is hoping to shine again thanks to the pipeline shake-up and cost cuts.The company said earnings per share (EPS) are likely to rise by about 5% in 2020. That is on par with a similar target last year, which it ultimately surpassed. EPS growth reached 6.8% in 2019 as net income rose 7% to 7.5 billion euros ($8.25 billion).Booming Dupixent sales helped to boost revenue in Sanofi’s fourth quarter to 9.6 billion euros, up 6.8% on a reported basis, even though growth in vaccines, another area it is prioritising, was a little weaker than Jefferies analysts had expected.The company said it was on track to increase annual sales of Dupixent - developed with U.S firm Regeneron REGN.O - to 10 billion euros in the longer term, from 2.1 billion euros now. ""I am encouraged by the fourth-quarter results, which position Sanofi to deliver on our new strategic priorities,"" said CEO Paul Hudson, a former Novartis NOVN.S executive who led Sanofi's revamp. In December Sanofi also set a target of reaching a core operating margin of 30% by 2022. It stood at 27% at the end of 2019 and Sanofi said it was “trending towards” its goal.Shares in the French drugmaker were up 2.4% by 0913 GMT.Like rivals such as Britain's GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L and Switzerland's Novartis, Sanofi, which announced cost savings targets last month, is trying to zoom in on potential blockbuster treatments and has halted unsuccessful programmes. Hit by patent losses and a drop in sales, Sanofi said in December that it would end research in diabetes and cardiovascular diseases to devote more efforts to the lucrative field of cancer medicines.It is also aiming for an extra 2 billion euros of cost savings by 2022, including in its supply chain."

2020-2-21,Esperion says cholesterol drug gets U.S. approval; eyes $10 per pill pricing,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN20F2NQ,"(Reuters) - Esperion Therapeutics Inc said on Friday that U.S. health regulators approved its cholesterol-lowering drug, making it the first non-statin treatment to be cleared for sale in the country in nearly 20 years.The drug, bempedoic acid, to be used as an add-on treatment with statins, lowers bad cholesterol or low-density lipoprotein (LDL) by inhibiting its synthesis in the liver and is aimed at patients with high cardiovascular risk, the company said in a statement.The oral treatment, which will be sold under the brand name Nexletol, is expected to be priced at around $10 per pill and will be available in the United States through prescription from March 30, Esperion said.The approval of bempedoic acid is an important de-risking milestone for the company and marks its transition from a clinical-stage story to a commercial-stage story, Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said.The drug’s approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration comes after studies showed an 18% to 28% fall in LDL cholesterol, compared with placebo, in patients who were also on statin.High LDL cholesterol is known to raise the risk of heart attacks or strokes as it leads to fat build-up on the walls of arteries. About 18 million Americans with heart disease live with elevated levels of LDL cholesterol, Esperion said.Half of these patients are unable to keep their cholesterol in check despite being on statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor, while the other half cannot tolerate statin due to side effects such as muscle pain, nausea, and liver dysfunction, according to the company.“Having a non-statin, once-a-day pill to combine with statin is really what physicians see as needed today,” Esperion Chief Executive Officer Tim Mayleben told Reuters.Mayleben also said the company was in active discussions with insurers to ensure that patients have access to the drug.Injectable drugs such as Sanofi SA and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc’s Praluent and Amgen Inc’s Repatha are not popular with insurers, given that they are priced at about $6,000 a year.Stifel analyst Derek Archila expects the drug to bring in sales of about $3 billion by 2029 at its peak.Esperion has also submitted a marketing application for the approval of bempedoic acid in combination with ezetimibe, another cholesterol-lowering drug. The FDA is expected to announce its final decision by Feb. 26.Shares of the company were up marginally in trading after the bell."
2020-2-24,Keeping up regular AMD treatment visits tied to less vision loss over time,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN20I2E3,"(Reuters Health) - People with a common age-related eye disease who show up regularly for their doctor’s visits get to keep more of their sight than those who skip appointments or stretch the time between visits, a new analysis suggests.Researchers examined data from a two-year study that compared different treatments for age-related macular degeneration (AMD), a leading cause of vision loss in the United States.About 90% of patients stuck to a schedule of monthly visits, but the rest skipped or delayed visits for weeks or months.At the end of the trial, the largest difference in vision sharpness was seen between the group considered “on time,” with 28 to 35 days between clinic appointments, and those who were “very late,” with over 60 days between visits.“There was a 12.5 letter difference between people who were poorly adherent and people who stuck to their visit schedule. That translates to roughly two and a half lines on the chart most eye doctors hang in their offices!” said study coauthor Dr. Brian VanderBeek of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.“I was pretty surprised that there was such a dramatic difference between those two groups,” VanderBeek said in a phone interview.The magnitude of the association between visit adherence and improved vision suggests substantial effort should be made to strive for visit adherence, the researchers write in JAMA Ophthalmology.But getting treatment for the condition can be an onerous task.Patients are usually elderly and often require caregivers to accompany them on monthly trips to a clinic, where they receive an injection directly into the eye.“The injections are not fun,” VanderBeek said.“Most patients do not like the experience - unfortunately we do not have another way of giving them the medication. (And) it’s not like you come into the office for 10 minutes and then you just leave. Usually you’re there for an hour or two.”“When you put all of those factors together it creates an environment where it’s often very difficult for patients to get the care they need as frequently as they need it.”Dr. Shriji Patel of the Vanderbilt Eye Institute in Nashville, Tennessee, who coauthored a commentary accompanying the study, said achieving the level of visit adherence enforced during clinical trials in day-to-day practice is “nearly impossible.”This could explain why data from electronic medical records show anti-VEGF treatments, the gold standard at present, don’t work as well at improving vision in practice as they seem to in clinical trials, he told Reuters Health.Anti-VEGF treatments like Lucentis from Roche AG and Novartis, Avastin from Roche and Eylea from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Bayer AG are initially administered once a month. “After that, retina specialists differ ... but the majority adopt what is known as a ‘treat-and-extend’ regimen, where they slowly increase the interval between subsequent injections,” Patel explained.The new analysis was of high quality, Patel noted, though the fact that the trial wasn’t originally designed to determine the link between visit adherence and vision improvement makes the conclusions less reliable.VanderBeek also commented on the variability between clinical trial results and those achieved in practice.“In the real world outside of clinical trials, decisions for when and where to follow up to be treated are not uniform across physicians,” he said.“There’s a lot of input from both physicians and patients into when follow up should occur, which causes a lot of variability in how frequently patients are seen.”SOURCE: bit.ly/2HpCjNG and bit.ly/39ZbE6T JAMA Ophthalmology, online February 6, 2020."
2020-3-02,Trump administration says drug makers will work together to combat coronavirus,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN20Q042,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration said on Monday it had secured commitments from top pharmaceutical companies to work together to develop a vaccine and treatments to fight the coronavirus.At a meeting with industry executives at the White House, President Donald Trump exhorted the companies to collaborate to speed the process of getting a vaccine and therapeutics to victims of the virus.The company leaders indicated a willingness to cooperate with one another, but did not lay out how that would happen.The White House, which has clashed previously with the pharmaceutical industry over high drug prices and has been struggling in recent weeks to show it is on top of the virus response, saw the meeting as a victory.“This is all hands on deck. And the news out of this meeting that you’ve already formed a consortia ... now we know they will be working together to create therapeutics and ultimately a new vaccine,” Vice President Mike Pence said as the session drew to a close.The global death toll from the illness caused by the new coronavirus now exceeds 3,000, with more than 60 countries affected. In the United States, there have been more than 90 cases, with six deaths.Trump pressed the representatives at the table about their timeframes for getting a vaccine ready and took upbeat comments from some of the company leaders to mean that it could be ready to deploy within months.“You seem to know what the answer is to this,” Trump said. “Get it done. We need it.”Pressed on whether the vaccine would be ready in the short timeframe he desired, Trump said he had heard from the leaders at the table a range of three to four months to a year. But Anthony Fauci, who heads the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious diseases, stepped in and urged those at the table to correct the president’s impression.“He’s asking the question: When is it going to be deployable? And that is going to be at the earliest a year to a year and a half,” Fauci said.Trump, who has sought to suggest a vaccine would be ready before health professionals have indicated, followed up after Fauci’s comments: “You think that’s right?”Attendees assured him that treatments, rather than a vaccine itself, could be ready before that.Attendees included the chief executives of Gilead Sciences Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, Moderna Inc and GlaxoSmithKline Plc as well as research and development executives from Pfizer Inc, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi SA, all of which are working on vaccines or treatments for the virus.Even with Trump voicing hope that the companies can accelerate their development as much as possible, executives and other experts have suggested that clinical trials to guarantee a vaccine is safe and effective could mean that it could take a minimum of 12 to 18 months to hit the market.Antiviral treatments could possibly move faster toward approval.Pfizer’s chief scientific officer, Mikael Dolsten, told Trump the company had identified compounds that had a high probability of being effective against the virus.After the meeting, Pfizer said in a statement it had identified some antiviral compounds it owns as potential treatments for coronaviruses and was working with a third party to evaluate them.It said if they proved to be good candidates and passed toxicology studies, it hoped to start testing them clinically by the end of the year."

2020-3-16,Trials of potential coronavirus treatments start for some existing drugs,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21331M,"(Reuters) - Drugs used for treating arthritis are being tested as treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by a new coronavirus, as researchers rush to find ways of helping patients and slowing the number of infections.Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals said on Monday they began a clinical trial of their rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara as a coronavirus treatment, while in Spain a separate trial is studying if a combination of two drugs can slow down the spread of coronavirus among people.Enrolments for the mid-to-late stage trial of Kevzara, an immune-system modifying drug known as a monoclonal antibody, will begin immediately and test up to 400 patients, Sanofi and Regeneron said in a joint statement.Regeneron in February announced a partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to develop a treatment for the new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV2, and said it would focus on monoclonal antibodies.The virus that emerged in central China in December has now infected more than 179,000 people worldwide, according to the Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking these figures.Doctors have seen that many of those who become critically ill from SARS-CoV2 are experiencing a so-called cytokine storm, which happens when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body’s organs. Some researchers think drugs that can suppress the immune system, including monoclonal antibodies, might be useful for limiting this autoimmune response.Meanwhile, Barcelona-based researchers said on Monday they would administer a drug used to treat HIV - containing darunavir and cobicistat - to a coronavirus-infected person.The patient’s close contacts would be administered hydroxychloroquine, a drug for malaria and rheumatoid conditions because laboratory experiments suggest it prevents this strain of coronavirus from reproducing.“The goal of our study is to separate the transmission chains,” Oriol Mitja, researcher at Germans Trias i Pujol Research Institute, told a news briefing.Patients with coronavirus can infect between 5% and 15% of the people they come into contact with during the 14 days after starting to show symptoms, he said.The trial’s goal is to reduce that number below 14 days and also to reduce the percentage of contacts infected and researchers plan to analyze the results in 21 days.Around 200 patients with coronavirus and 3,000 of their close contacts will take part in the trial, which has private and public funding.Mitja - who plans to talk with World Health Organization officials this week - said there were two other similar projects in Australia and the United States, but that his is in the lead.Also on Monday, Madrid’s La Paz-Carlos III hospital announced a trial to administer another antiviral drug, Remdesivir, to voluntary patients with serious and milder cases of coronavirus, Madrid’s regional government said in a statement.About 1,000 patients will take part in the European-wide trial, it said."

It’s yet to be seen what the exact combination would be,” Bowie added.The efforts are a part of its partnership with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. Regeneron also said it was working with the U.S. Biomedical Advanced Research and Defense Authority to its increase manufacturing capacity.In addition to the development of the antibody cocktail, the drugmaker is testing its rheumatoid arthritis drug, Kevzara, with partner Sanofi against the virus.The company’s shares were up at $494.99 in afternoon trading."

2020-3-19,Two generic drugs being tested in U.S. in race to find coronavirus treatments,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2BA22C,"March 19 (Reuters) - U.S. researchers, following the lead of scientists in other countries, have launched studies to see whether widely-available, low-cost generic drugs can be used to help treat the illness caused by the new coronavirus.There are currently no vaccines or treatments for the highly-contagious COVID-19 respiratory illness, so patients can only receive supportive care for now.But a 1,500-person trial, led by the University of Minnesota, began this week to see whether malaria treatment hydroxychloroquine can prevent or reduce the severity of COVID-19. Two other trials are studying the blood pressure drug losartan as a possible treatment for the disease.The malaria drug, also being tested in China, Australia and France, was touted earlier this week by Tesla Chief Executive Elon Musk, who recovered from malaria in 2000 after taking the medication.Besides having a direct antiviral effect, hydroxychloroquine suppresses the production and release of proteins involved in the inflammatory complications of several viral diseases.“We are trying to leverage the science to see if we can do something in addition to minimizing contacts,” said Dr. Jakub Tolar, dean of the University of Minnesota Medical School and vice president for clinical affairs. “Results are likely in weeks, not months.”Most people infected with the new coronavirus develop only mild flu-like symptoms, but around 20 percent can have more severe disease that can lead to pneumonia requiring hospitalization.The fast-spreading virus, which emerged in China in December and is now in more than 150 countries, has infected more than 214,000 and killed over 8,700 people worldwide, including at least 145 in the United States. Experts say it could take a year or more to have a preventive vaccine ready, so effective treatments are desperately needed.A French team on Tuesday said initial results from a 24-patient trial of hydroxychloroquine showed that 25% of patients given the drug still carried the coronavirus after six days, compared with 90% of patients given a placebo.Tolar said he bought 1,500 doses of hydroxychloroquine for a “laughable” amount of money. “We don’t need a multibillion-dollar investment. It is part of the beauty of this approach,” he said.But he and others cautioned that people should not be using any prescription drugs without medical oversight.“These treatments should be used only in hospitals by critical care specialists,” said Dr. Russel Buhr, critical care pulmonologist at the University of California, Los Angeles.Also this week, the University of Minnesota launched two trials testing losartan - one to measure whether the hypertension drug reduces the risk of organ failure for COVID-19 patients who have been hospitalized, and another looking at whether the drug can limit the need for hospitalizations.Losartan is an angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1R) blocker, which researchers say could play a role in blocking an enzyme used by the virus to bind to cells.Pharmaceutical companies are also working to develop treatments for COVID-19, including Gilead Sciences Inc’s experimental antiviral drug remdesivir, which is given to hospitalized patients via intravenous infusion over several days.The New England Journal of Medicine earlier this month described how the drug was successfully used on the first patient infected by the novel coronavirus in the United States.Results from a remdesivir trial in China could come early next month, while Gilead has begun two international trials of the drug that previously failed as a potential Ebola treatment. And the National Institutes of Health last month began testing it on patients in a U.S. trial.“We are focusing on high risk patients,” said Dr. Andre Kalil, infectious disease specialist at the University of Nebraska Medical Center and the U.S. trial’s lead investigator. “Our hope is that remdesivir will show that patients will be improving faster.”Companies including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, Eli Lilly and Co and Takeda Pharmaceutical Co have begun to develop coronavirus treatment candidates, but human testing of their drugs has not yet started.Anti-inflammatory drugs, like Regeneron’s Kevzara and Roche Holding AG’s Actemra, have been used to treat the lung inflammation caused by COVID-19.But in a disappointment, Chinese investigators reported this week that Kaletra, a combination HIV drug sold by AbbVie , failed to improve outcomes for seriously ill COVID-19 patients.

2020-3-30,"Sanofi, Regeneron expand testing of potential coronavirus treatment",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2BM0CK,"(Reuters) - Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc have expanded a clinical trial of their rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara as a coronavirus treatment to patients outside the United States.The companies said enrolments for the mid-to-late stage trial of Kevzara, an immune-system modifying drug known as a monoclonal antibody, have now started in Italy, Spain, Germany, France, Canada, and Russia. The U.S. trials began last week.The trial, expected to enroll about 300 patients, will recruit hospitalized patients from several countries who are severely or critically ill with COVID-19 infection, a disease caused by the highly contagious coronavirus.The new coronavirus, called SARS-CoV2, has now infected more than 700,000 people worldwide, and over 30,000 people have died from it, according to a Reuters tally.Doctors have seen that many of those who become critically ill from SARS-CoV2 are experiencing a so-called cytokine storm, which happens when the immune system overreacts and attacks the body’s organs. Some researchers think drugs that can suppress the immune system, including monoclonal antibodies, might be useful for limiting this autoimmune response.The United States has the most reported cases of any country in the world, with more than 130,000 cases of COVID-19.Italy and Spain have been two of the worst-hit countries in Europe, recording the highest and the second highest death toll from coronavirus of any country in the world, respectively.Regeneron is leading the U.S. trials, while Sanofi is leading trials outside the U.S."
2020-3-30,MORNING BID-The best laid plans of mice and men...,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2BN2LL,"A look at the day ahead from EMEA deputy markets editor Sujata Rao. The views expressed are her own.More than $10 trillion in stimulus – fiscal, monetary and increasingly unorthodox – is being deployed against the crisis, including 150 basis points in Fed rates cuts, repo operations, swaplines and short-term funding to ease strains in money markets. Bob Michele at JPMorgan Asset Management describes it as “the greatest mobilisation of sweeping policy that any of us have ever witnessed.”But will it be enough? Markets seem uncertain – after Friday’s selloff, we had a shaky start in Asia and now Europe markets are up as are U.S. equity futures.A frisson of nervousness still runs through markets, however, with euro-dollar volatility climbing back to 10.5% after falling under 10% at the end of last week. The dollar is up 0.5% this morning, having posted its biggest weekly fall last week since 2009. Currency swaps are calmer, but the FRA-OIS spread, a barometer of risk in the interbank market, has widened to 120 basis points. Will that market emerge as a point of stress?Oil prices reflect demand destruction being wrought by the virus (along with Saudi determination to bring fellow producer Russia to heel) -- Brent futures dropped to $23.03, the lowest since November 2002. As a reference point, note that a price of around $45 is needed for even the most efficient oil producer nations to balance their budgets.Asian shares fell too, with mainland Chinese markets shedding 1.6% even though the PBoC cut the 7-day reverse repo rate to 2.2% from 2.4% -- the biggest cut since 2015. The Monetary Authority of Singapore also lowered the midpoint of its currency band and reduced the slope to zero, implying a weaker exchange rate to help support export-driven growth.The problem is that despite all the best laid plans of mice and men, things have a habit of going wrong. The news on the virus front isn’t great, with a U.S. death toll increasing past 2,000, the global count at over 33,000. It’s even starting to claim the lives of the great and the good, with the CFO of financial firm Jefferies succumbing to it. The virus is now tearing across other markets, including in the developing world, such as Turkey and Argentina.And it wont be long before investors start counting the potential costs of all these rescue packages. That is likely to spur more talk of adopting yield curve control to accommodate widening budget deficits and give governments more clarity over borrowing costs.On currency markets, dollar has gained again and the euro’s $1.10 level may be tested to the downside by German preliminary inflation data, which should show a fall. The pound is down 1% - Fitch cut UK ratings and a government expert said she expected some lockdown measures to last six months.Emerging currencies remain under the cosh – the lira is down 1% and the rand has lost 2% following Moody’s (expected) decision to strip South Africa of its last remaining investment- grade rating. Local bond yields have surged 50 basis points as IG-only funds will soon start beating a retreat; up to $11 billion may flee once the country is ejected from key global bond indexes.For European equities, there is one certainty: a dividend winter looms. The Bank for International Settlements has called for a global bank dividend ban and UniCredit became the first Italian bank to comply with the European Central Bank call to put dividend and buybacks on hold. It was followed by Dutch lenders ING and ABN AMRO, which will suspend dividend payments until at least October. One exception outside the EU is UBS, which maintained its 2019 dividend.The pay-out freeze extends far and wide with the Sweden’s SSAB scrapping 2019 dividends, less than a week after the steelmaker halved its original payout proposal.Meanwhile, headlines scream of mounting corporate losses -- Volkswagen Chief Executive Herbert Diess told German TV channel ZDF his company was burning through $2.2 bln a week with production halted by the coronavirus pandemic. Nissan just announced that its global vehicles sales fell by 24.2%. British fashion chain Next has cut off its remaining source of revenue and shut its online business, bowing to pressure from workers worried about their health.More companies joined in to warn investors about the recession, with ABB saying all of its businesses would suffer in the first quarter.Other coronavirus-led headlines for European equities include: British accounting firm KPMG’s chairman testing positive for the coronavirus; a new version of a breathing aid has been developed in less a week by a team involving Mercedes Formula One, which is being tested at London hospitals. Sanofi and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals have expanded a clinical trial of their rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara as a coronavirus treatment to patients outside the United States.Emerging-market stocks fell for a second straight day, with the MSCI index down 1.2%. Emerging currencies paint an equally glum picture, with the broader index slipping 0.4%. Aside form the ones already mentioned above, Mexico’s peso – a lightning rod for its exposure to oil and the U.S. economy – fell around 2%.Fears of capital controls across emerging markets are on investors’ minds -- Egypt said it was limiting the amount of money individuals can withdraw from banks after the central bank governor said nearly $2 billion had been withdrawn in the past three weeks.

2020-4-02,Healthcare stocks show their defensive allure in ailing market,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21K275,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - The coronavirus pandemic is throwing a spotlight on stocks in the U.S. healthcare sector, home to the companies that could develop treatments, vaccines and improved diagnostics needed to tackle the greatest public health crisis in a century.Healthcare has held up better than most S&P 500 sectors. Since the S&P 500 hit an all-time high on Feb. 19, healthcare is down about 18% as of Wednesday, while the benchmark index has tumbled 27%.The sector is typically considered a defensive area of the market because some investors believe consumers will continue buying healthcare products even during uncertain times.Shares of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies have led the pack, including those working on potential treatments and other ways to address the rapidly spreading outbreak.In particular, shares of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Gilead Sciences Inc have risen 24% and 8%, respectively, since the S&P hit its peak.“A lot of these companies are working on a solution to the problem,” said Walter Todd, chief investment officer with Greenwood Capital in South Carolina. “We can debate what it means to them ... monetarily, but perception-wise they are viewed as a safe haven because of that.”Greenwood Capital in recent weeks bought shares of Regeneron and Roche Holding AG, a Swiss company that has diagnostics and a potential therapy for the new coronavirus.The purchases added to the firm’s overweight position in healthcare, although it has pared its sector holdings during the recent outperformance, Todd said.Healthcare lagged the market’s big gains in 2019. Institutional investors generally held a lower weighting in healthcare relative to benchmark indexes before the pandemic took hold this year, said Rebecca Chesworth, senior equities strategist at State Street Global Advisors.Healthcare “has been one of the most popular places to put money in the past couple of weeks,” she added.The sector recently traded at 12.9 times forward 12-month earnings estimates, compared to 14 times for the overall S&P 500, according to Refinitiv Datastream.Pharmaceutical and biotech stocks, including Eli Lilly and Co and Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc, make up eight of the sector’s top ten performers since Feb. 19, all of which have gained or fallen far less than the broader market.“In general, if you are on a drug, you are staying on that drug,” said Teresa McRoberts, a portfolio manager who focuses on healthcare at Fred Alger Management. “So that part of their business is pretty safe.”Some areas of the sector have been hit hard by the vast ripple effects of the virus, particularly medical device companies dependent on elective procedures that are being delayed to preserve hospital capacity and resources for coronavirus patients. Shares of Zimmer Biomet Holdings and Stryker Corp, which make knee and hip replacements, are down 44% and 36%, respectively, since Feb 19.Shares of hospital chain HCA Healthcare Inc have slumped 44% over that period as hospitals lose high-margin elective procedures and cope with severe disruption from the influx of coronavirus patients, said Jeff Jonas, healthcare portfolio manager with Gabelli Funds.Jonas, however, believes those areas could be quicker to recover than other parts of the economy when the pandemic recedes.“You’re going to be more nervous about getting on a plane, staying in a hotel, going out to dinner in the aftermath of this then you are about going back to see your doctor or to get a procedure done,” he said."
2020-4-02,Exclusive: Sanofi can produce millions of doses of potential coronavirus drug - CEO,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21K3AD,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi SA will be able to provide millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine for patients with the illness caused by the novel coronavirus if the old malaria drug proves successful in clinical trials, its chief executive told Reuters on Thursday.Paul Hudson, who became CEO of the French drugmaker in September, said in an interview that the company is currently manufacturing at over 93% capacity during the pandemic.He said the company had made a choice to “overproduce” its drugs to ensure supplies for hospitals in Europe and the United States facing an unprecedented crush of patients suffering from respiratory complications that is threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems.Hospital executives and doctors from nine European countries, in an open letter on Wednesday, said they only had up to two weeks worth of some medicines used in intensive care units and urged greater European collaboration.European Union countries will have access to the medicines they need, the bloc’s industry chief Thierry Breton said on Thursday in an attempt to reassure the public. Hudson said Sanofi was not at full manufacturing capacity because workers with coronavirus symptoms such as fever, and any employee who had been in close contact with them, are sent home for two weeks. “We are overly cautious. One person getting a temperature means we lose maybe a half dozen people,” he said. Sanofi operates 73 industrial locations in 32 countries. “More than 80% of the medicines we make are considered essential. So, you know, everywhere we are working, we are pretty much working every hour,” Hudson said.The company began manufacturing as much hydroxychloroquine as it could in February, after Chinese data suggested the malaria drug could help some patients with COVID-19. Sanofi sells the drug, which has been in use since the 1950s, under the brand name Plaquenil in some countries.The new coronavirus emerged in China in December and has since spread around the world. It has infected over 1 million people globally and killed more than 51,400.Sanofi is also developing two potential vaccines against the coronavirus, and is testing the rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara it sells in partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc as a potential COVID-19 treatment.Demand for hydroxychloroquine surged after U.S. President Donald Trump touted it as a potential “game changer” for the pandemic and U.S. regulators have since authorized its emergency use for coronavirus patients.But the small Chinese trial had many limitations and the European Commission has said there is no evidence yet that the drug is effective for coronavirus patients.Sanofi has fielded requests for the drug, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, from countries all over the world, Hudson said.He added that Sanofi is working with other companies to make sure the supply of hydroxychloroquine is as broad as possible.“We just tried to coordinate a little bit to say to companies, ‘Let’s all not end up supplying the same market. Let’s make sure that everybody has a chance that needs it,’” Hudson said. If one area is well supplied, he added, “then we’re happy to help somewhere else.”There is still much to learn about who is most likely to be helped by the drug and at what dose before companies can accurately estimate supply demand if the treatment proves effective.“It’s important to know whether you would give it to mild patients or severe patients,” Hudson explained. “The sheer volume difference in those patients is significant.”"
2020-4-02,EXCLUSIVE-Sanofi can produce millions of doses of potential coronavirus drug -CEO,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2BQ205,"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi SA will be able to provide millions of doses of hydroxychloroquine for patients with the illness caused by the novel coronavirus if the old malaria drug proves successful in clinical trials, its chief executive told Reuters on Thursday.Paul Hudson, who became CEO of the French drugmaker in September, said in an interview that the company is currently manufacturing at over 93% capacity during the pandemic.He said the company had made a choice to “overproduce” its drugs to ensure supplies for hospitals in Europe and the United States facing an unprecedented crush of patients suffering from respiratory complications that is threatening to overwhelm healthcare systems.Hospital executives and doctors from nine European countries, in an open letter on Wednesday, said they only had up to two weeks worth of some medicines used in intensive care units and urged greater European collaboration.European Union countries will have access to the medicines they need, the bloc’s industry chief Thierry Breton said on Thursday in an attempt to reassure the public. Hudson said Sanofi was not at full manufacturing capacity because workers with coronavirus symptoms such as fever, and any employee who had been in close contact with them, are sent home for two weeks. “We are overly cautious. One person getting a temperature means we lose maybe a half dozen people,” he said. Sanofi operates 73 industrial locations in 32 countries. “More than 80% of the medicines we make are considered essential. So, you know, everywhere we are working, we are pretty much working every hour,” Hudson said.The company began manufacturing as much hydroxychloroquine as it could in February, after Chinese data suggested the malaria drug could help some patients with COVID-19. Sanofi sells the drug, which has been in use since the 1950s, under the brand name Plaquenil in some countries.The new coronavirus emerged in China in December and has since spread around the world. It has infected over 1 million people globally and killed more than 51,400.Sanofi is also developing two potential vaccines against the coronavirus, and is testing the rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara it sells in partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc as a potential COVID-19 treatment.Demand for hydroxychloroquine surged after U.S. President Donald Trump touted it as a potential “game changer” for the pandemic and U.S. regulators have since authorized its emergency use for coronavirus patients.But the small Chinese trial had many limitations and the European Commission has said there is no evidence yet that the drug is effective for coronavirus patients.Sanofi has fielded requests for the drug, which is also used to treat lupus and rheumatoid arthritis, from countries all over the world, Hudson said.He added that Sanofi is working with other companies to make sure the supply of hydroxychloroquine is as broad as possible.“We just tried to coordinate a little bit to say to companies, ‘Let’s all not end up supplying the same market. Let’s make sure that everybody has a chance that needs it,’” Hudson said. If one area is well supplied, he added, “then we’re happy to help somewhere else.”There is still much to learn about who is most likely to be helped by the drug and at what dose before companies can accurately estimate supply demand if the treatment proves effective.“It’s important to know whether you would give it to mild patients or severe patients,” Hudson explained. “The sheer volume difference in those patients is significant.”"

2020-4-06,"SPECIAL REPORT-Drug Trump touts for virus in wide use, without hard evidence it works",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2BU1HX,"(For more Reuters Special Reports, click on)NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES, April 6 (Reuters) - The decades-old drug that President Donald Trump has persistently promoted as a potential weapon against COVID-19 has within a matter of weeks become a standard of care in areas of the United States hit hard by the pandemic — though doctors prescribing it have no idea whether it works.Doctors and pharmacists from more than half a dozen large healthcare systems in New York, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Washington and California told Reuters they are routinely using hydroxychloroquine on patients hospitalized with COVID-19. At the same time, several said they have seen no evidence that the drug, used for years to treat malaria and autoimmune disorders, has any effect on the virus.Use of hydroxychloroquine has soared as the United States has quickly become the epicenter of the pandemic. More than 355,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and more than 10,000 have died. The federal government estimates that as many as 240,000 people in the country may die from the disease before the outbreak is over.Facing those numbers, and in the absence of any known effective treatments, doctors on the frontlines said they began using hydroxychloroquine and the related chloroquine on patients who are deteriorating based on a few small studies suggesting a possible benefit. Some said they had come under pressure from patients to use the therapies widely touted by Trump and other supporters.“I may take it,” Trump said on Saturday, referring to hydroxychloroquine, though he has twice tested negative for coronavirus, according to the White House. “We’re just hearing really positive stories, and we’re continuing to collect the data.”Potential side effects of hydroxychloroquine include vision loss and heart problems. But doctors interviewed by Reuters say they are comfortable prescribing the drug for a short course of several days for coronavirus patients because the risks are relatively low and the therapies are inexpensive and generally available.However, protocols directing how these drugs should be used vary from one hospital to another, including when to introduce them and whether to combine them with other drugs. In addition, some studies showing promise involve patients who took the therapies for mild or early-stage illness. Many of those people are likely to recover from the virus on their own.Patients admitted to the hospital in the United States are generally much sicker than the mildly ill cases cited in such studies when they receive therapy. These factors, doctors said, have made it difficult for them to determine whether the drugs are making a difference.“I have seen hundreds of patients with severe COVID and most of these people are on hydroxychloroquine,” Dr Mangala Narasimhan, regional director of critical care at Northwell Health, a 23-hospital system in New York, said in an email. “In my opinion, although it is very early, I do not see a dramatic improvement from the hydroxychloroquine in these patients.”Dr Daniel McQuillen, an infectious disease specialist at Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts, said he has prescribed a course of hydroxychloroquine for about 30 COVID-19 patients so far because the drug has shown “a little bit of antiviral activity.” But he has not seen “marked improvement for patients.”“Anecdotally, it may have had limited effect in patients with milder disease,” McQuillen said. The therapy “has had no effect in limiting or slowing progression of our patients that have been at or near ICU level when they arrived.”‘SEE WHAT STICKS’The experience of David Lat, a legal recruiter and commentator who founded the blog Above the Law, reflects the mixture of hope and uncertainty surrounding the drugs now being pursued as possible coronavirus treatments.Since early March, the 44-year-old New Yorker has chronicled his near-fatal infection with coronavirus in social media posts followed by thousands of people. Lat’s case has resonated with a U.S. audience that has begun to recognize the risk that coronavirus poses not only to elderly patients with serious medical conditions, but also to generally healthy younger adults.After more than a week of worsening symptoms, Lat was admitted to NYU Langone Medical Center on March 16 and later placed on a ventilator. On March 28, he shared on Facebook that his doctors had taken him off of the ventilator and had moved him out of intensive care after his condition improved dramatically.In an exchange of text messages with Reuters, Lat said he was treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin. He also received two therapies known as interleukin-6 inhibitors that help regulate an overreaction by the body’s immune system thought to trigger the respiratory distress seen in severe COVID-19: the arthritis treatment Kevzara and the experimental compound clazakizumab.“The doctors haven’t concluded what caused my recovery,” Lat said. “The state of coronavirus research is very much ‘throw stuff against a wall and see what sticks’ – but when something does stick, in terms of a good patient outcome, you’re not sure what stuck.” Lat’s doctors were not immediately available to comment on his treatment.Some doctors have been vocal in advocating the drug. Dr Vladimir Zelenko, a general practitioner in upstate New York, has claimed that a three-drug cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc sulfate has helped mitigate the infection in nearly 200 hundred of his patients before they became sick enough to require hospitalization. His recommendations have attracted the attention of Trump’s supporters. Zelenko wasn’t immediately available for comment.Despite such encouraging reports, hard evidence that any of the therapies now under study will work is weeks and possibly months way.Early, but mixed, data has emerged from COVID-19 trials of the malaria drugs in China. A research team in Marseilles, France, has published data showing that out of 80 mild COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 93 percent had no detectable levels of the virus after eight days.Doctors have questioned the value of the Marseille study and several papers from China as being too small or poorly designed to offer hard evidence of benefit. Most do not compare outcomes of patients who received the malaria therapies with people who did not, considered the most reliable measure of a drug’s effectiveness.Last week, doctors in Paris reported that they tried to replicate the results of the Marseille study and failed. Results from a trial conducted in Wuhan, China, were released that included a control group of patients who did not receive the anti-malarial therapy for comparison. But critics questioned why information on the trial’s main goal -- detecting viral load -- was not disclosed, and said data was missing for some patients.More rigorous U.S.-led trials are now underway. But most focus on whether the drugs can help prevent illness in people exposed to the coronavirus, such as healthcare workers or relatives of confirmed patients, and not people who are already sick. Randomized, controlled trials of the drugs are being conducted in other countries, including China, Brazil and Norway.Until the evidence is in, “each institution is setting their own treatment guidelines,” said Dr Otto Yang, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center. “There is simply no data,” he said. “It is a matter of opinion, and opinions differ.”Trump is deeply invested in the idea that the malaria drugs will show a benefit, and personally pressured federal health officials to make them available, Reuters reported on Saturday . The president announced on Twitter last month that hydroxychloroquine, when combined with azithromycin, has the potential to become “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”In late March, the Department of Health and Human Services accepted donations of millions of doses of the drugs from manufacturers Novartis AG and Bayer AG.“President Trump is taking every possible step to protect Americans from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in announcing delivery of the doses to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile, which houses medical and other supplies needed to address pandemics or biological threats.Several of Trump’s top health officials, including Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, frequently caution that it is too early to promote hydroxychloroquine until results from more rigorous trials are available. While some studies suggest a benefit, “we’ve got to be careful that we don’t make that majestic leap to assume that this is a knockout drug,” Fauci told cable network Fox News on Friday.The Food and Drug Administration has not approved hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, but the agency has provided an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs to be used in clinical trials or for hospitalized patients when a doctor deems it appropriate.“We have not taken a stance, nor are we, on whether doctors should prescribe it,” FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn told Fox News last week. “We’re providing facts and information about the risks and benefits, but that really is and should be a doctor-patient decision.”The sudden, unexpected surge in demand for the drugs to treat coronavirus is coming at a cost to the many patients who take them regularly to treat the debilitating symptoms of autoimmune disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.Within hours of Trump’s initial endorsement on March 19, pharmaceutical supply chain experts reported shortages as doctors began prescribing hydroxychloroquine for themselves and their families. Vizient Inc, which works with about half of the country’s hospitals to buy drugs, told Reuters that orders for hydroxychloroquine jumped to around 1.8 million tablets per day in late March, up from an average of around 40,000 tablets per day in late January.“For many lupus patients, (hydroxychloroquine) is a life saver,” patient advocacy group Lupus LA wrote in an emailed statement. “These patients are now having trouble accessing their medication, putting them in a dire situation.”Several U.S. states and health insurers are taking steps to limit prescriptions, while Trump issued an executive order on March 23 to keep Americans from hoarding or price gouging.While the antimalarial approach, and its vocal advocates, are dominating headlines, doctors are still hopeful that one or more of the other therapies being tested will begin to show success.UCLA and Northwell are among more than three dozen medical centers participating in clinical trials of Gilead Science’s experimental antiviral remdesivir, which was previously tested as a treatment for Ebola but failed to show effectiveness. Initial data from a separate trial of the drug in China could be announced this month.“We feel like the hierarchy in terms of the evidence to support its use starts with remdesivir, then to hydroxychloroquine, and then it sort of rapidly deteriorates after that,” said Dr Arun Sanyal, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine.Some are keen to see whether blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients will spur immunity in others -- a method used more than 100 years ago. The FDA recently authorized expanded use of such donated plasma by hospitals across the country. McQuillen of Lahey Hospital said that approach has a good chance of succeeding.Others have focused on the potential of more advanced biologic medicines to quell the processes that put the body’s immune system into overdrive in severe COVID-19 cases.In fighting off the virus, the immune systems of these patients set off a so-called “cytokine storm,” releasing molecules into the blood that can cause dangerously high blood pressure, lung damage and eventual organ failure.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi SA are testing the arthritis drug Kevzara, or sarilumab. Roche has begun trials of Actemra, also known as tocilizumab. Both of them are IL-6 inhibitors, as is clazakizumab, under development by privately-held biotech Vitaeris Inc.Novartis plans a study of its drug Jakavi, or ruxolitinib, which can also help dial down a cytokine storm, in severe cases of COVID-19.“That’s where you’re going to see the most trials in the next month or two,” said Dr Kevin Tracey, CEO of Northwell Health’s research arm. “There are a lot of drugs that target the body’s reaction, rather than the virus itself.”"

2020-4-07,Wall Street volatility raises fears of another selloff,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21P3CQ,"(Reuters) - The evaporation of a rally on Wall Street in the closing minutes of Tuesday’s session shows that many investors fear the U.S. stock market is in danger of a renewed tumble due to uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus pandemic.Fueled by early signs of the outbreak plateauing in some U.S. hot spots, including New York State, the S&P 500 traded up as much as 3.5% during the session, only to lose ground sharply late in the day to finish down 0.16%. The index, however, remains up 19% from its March 23 low.Much of Wall Street’s recent recovery has been thanks to a $2 trillion package aimed at stimulating the economy as much of the country hibernates to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Still, many investors remained skeptical that Wall Street’s recent rise represents the start of a sustained recovery.The S&P 500 is still down more than 20% from its Feb. 19 record high. However, most of the index's constituents are worse off. The median change in the S&P 500 since Feb. 19 is a decline of 26%.

2020-4-07,Investors await data on coronavirus drugs as market rally builds,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21P34G,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Clinical data on potential treatments for the new coronavirus could help sustain a market bounce that has buoyed stocks after last month’s plunge, as investors look for signs that authorities may be able to stabilize the pandemic.Highly anticipated data for a Gilead Sciences Inc GILD.O experimental antiviral drug are expected later this month. Analysts are also awaiting results in the near-term for products already approved for other conditions from companies such as Roche Holding ROG.S and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O.While experts estimate an approved vaccine could be at least a year away, progress toward treatments that benefit some COVID-19 patients could help investors gauge when the epidemic could come under control and some economic activity might resume.“The more we see positive clinical data, the more investors will be comforted in the fact that this is a transitory issue like all epidemics are,” said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at National Securities.Early signs of a slowdown in hospitalizations and intensive care needs in coronavirus hotspots in the United States and abroad have fed a stock market turnaround sparked by massive support from the Federal Reserve and a more than $2 trillion government bailout. As of Monday, the S&P 500 .SPX was off about 21% from its Feb. 19 all-time high but had rebounded 19% since March 23.“With each incremental piece of good news, that gets us closer to the end of the epidemic and the economic damage that falls in its wake,” Hogan said.New York is nearing a plateau in the number of coronavirus patients hospitalized, Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Tuesday, even though the number of the deaths in the state hit a single-day high.Governments around the world have locked down their communities - urging citizens to stay inside and ordering restaurants, stores and other businesses shuttered - to contain the spread of COVID-19 cases, which have exceeded 1.4 million globally with over 80,000 deaths, according to a Johns Hopkins tally.Drugmakers are studying ways to combat the respiratory illness, for which there are no approved treatments, as hospitals face strains from the flood of patients.More than 330 clinical studies related to COVID-19 are listed in clinicaltrials.gov, a database maintained by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, including many seeking to test drugs already approved for other conditions.Gilead's remdesivir, which is administered intravenously, is one experimental treatment that has captured investors' attention. The biotechnology company's chief executive on March 28 said initial data would arrive in the ""coming weeks"" here and analysts said data could come in mid April.Remdesivir previously failed as a treatment for the Ebola virus. But it helped prevent disease and reduce severity of symptoms in monkeys infected with a virus more closely related to the new coronavirus in a study, raising hopes.Some analysts are cautioning against expecting that remdesivir will show an overwhelming benefit.Initial data are expected to come from studies of patients with relatively severe COVID-19. Because antivirals work best when patients are healthier, those results may show limited effectiveness, said Evan Seigerman, a biotech analyst at Credit Suisse.Even if remdesivir proves effective, the amount of the drug that would be available remains a concern. Gilead said last weekend here its existing supply could equate to more than 140,000 courses of treatment.Data is also anticipated for Regeneron REGN.O and Sanofi's SASY.PA Kevzara, perhaps by the end of the month, and for Roche's ROG.S Actemra - two similar rheumatoid arthritis drugs being tested for COVID-19 illness.Studies are also ongoing for hydroxychloroquine, a decades-old malaria drug that has been used by doctors for COVID-19 despite controversy over its effectiveness.“Just knowing that something works means investors can start thinking about the other side of this,” said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist/SunTrust Advisory Services, in emailed comments to Reuters, “both from a human side and an economic and market perspective.”"

The index, however, remains up 19% from its March 23 low.Much of Wall Street’s recent recovery has been thanks to a $2 trillion package aimed at stimulating the economy as much of the country hibernates to slow the spread of the coronavirus.Still, many investors remained skeptical that Wall Street’s recent rise represents the start of a sustained recovery.The S&P 500 is still down more than 20% from its Feb. 19 record high.

2020-4-07,"Special Report: Doctors embrace drug touted by Trump for COVID-19, without hard evidence it works",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21O2VO,"NEW YORK/LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - The decades-old drug that President Donald Trump has persistently promoted as a potential weapon against COVID-19 has within a matter of weeks become a standard of care in areas of the United States hit hard by the pandemic — though doctors prescribing it have no idea whether it works.Doctors and pharmacists from more than half a dozen large healthcare systems in New York, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Ohio, Washington and California told Reuters they are routinely using hydroxychloroquine on patients hospitalized with COVID-19. At the same time, several said they have seen no evidence that the drug, used for years to treat malaria and autoimmune disorders, has any effect on the virus.Use of hydroxychloroquine has soared as the United States has quickly become the epicenter of the pandemic. More than 355,000 people in the United States have tested positive for the novel coronavirus, and more than 10,000 have died. The federal government estimates that as many as 240,000 people in the country may die from the disease before the outbreak is over.Facing those numbers, and in the absence of any known effective treatments, doctors on the frontlines said they began using hydroxychloroquine and the related chloroquine on patients who are deteriorating based on a few small studies suggesting a possible benefit. Some said they had come under pressure from patients to use the therapies widely touted by Trump and other supporters.“I may take it,” Trump said on Saturday, referring to hydroxychloroquine, though he has twice tested negative for coronavirus, according to the White House. “We’re just hearing really positive stories, and we’re continuing to collect the data.”Potential side effects of hydroxychloroquine include vision loss and heart problems. But doctors interviewed by Reuters say they are comfortable prescribing the drug for a short course of several days for coronavirus patients because the risks are relatively low and the therapies are inexpensive and generally available.However, protocols directing how these drugs should be used vary from one hospital to another, including when to introduce them and whether to combine them with other drugs. In addition, some studies showing promise involve patients who took the therapies for mild or early-stage illness. Many of those people are likely to recover from the virus on their own.Patients admitted to the hospital in the United States are generally much sicker than the mildly ill cases cited in such studies when they receive therapy. These factors, doctors said, have made it difficult for them to determine whether the drugs are making a difference. “I have seen hundreds of patients with severe COVID and most of these people are on hydroxychloroquine,” Dr Mangala Narasimhan, regional director of critical care at Northwell Health, a 23-hospital system in New York, said in an email. “In my opinion, although it is very early, I do not see a dramatic improvement from the hydroxychloroquine in these patients.” Dr Daniel McQuillen, an infectious disease specialist at Lahey Hospital & Medical Center in Burlington, Massachusetts, said he has prescribed a course of hydroxychloroquine for about 30 COVID-19 patients so far because the drug has shown “a little bit of antiviral activity.” But he has not seen “marked improvement for patients.”“Anecdotally, it may have had limited effect in patients with milder disease,” McQuillen said. The therapy “has had no effect in limiting or slowing progression of our patients that have been at or near ICU level when they arrived.”‘SEE WHAT STICKS’The experience of David Lat, a legal recruiter and commentator who founded the blog Above the Law, reflects the mixture of hope and uncertainty surrounding the drugs now being pursued as possible coronavirus treatments.Since early March, the 44-year-old New Yorker has chronicled his near-fatal infection with coronavirus in social media posts followed by thousands of people. Lat’s case has resonated with a U.S. audience that has begun to recognize the risk that coronavirus poses not only to elderly patients with serious medical conditions, but also to generally healthy younger adults.After more than a week of worsening symptoms, Lat was admitted to NYU Langone Medical Center on March 16 and later placed on a ventilator. On March 28, he shared on Facebook that his doctors had taken him off of the ventilator and had moved him out of intensive care after his condition improved dramatically.In an exchange of text messages with Reuters, Lat said he was treated with hydroxychloroquine and the antibiotic azithromycin. He also received the experimental therapy clazakizumab, which aims to regulate an overreaction by the body’s immune system thought to trigger the respiratory distress seen in severe COVID-19. After the story was published, Lat clarified that he received a fourth therapy, the antiviral Kaletra, not Kevzara, as he had initially recalled.“The doctors haven’t concluded what caused my recovery,” Lat said. “The state of coronavirus research is very much ‘throw stuff against a wall and see what sticks’ – but when something does stick, in terms of a good patient outcome, you’re not sure what stuck.” Lat’s doctors were not immediately available to comment on his treatment.Some doctors have been vocal in advocating the drug. Dr Vladimir Zelenko, a general practitioner in upstate New York, has claimed that a three-drug cocktail of hydroxychloroquine, azithromycin and zinc sulfate has helped mitigate the infection in nearly 200 hundred of his patients before they became sick enough to require hospitalization. His recommendations have attracted the attention of Trump’s supporters. Zelenko wasn’t immediately available for comment.Despite such encouraging reports, hard evidence that any of the therapies now under study will work is weeks and possibly months way.Early, but mixed, data has emerged from COVID-19 trials of the malaria drugs in China. A research team in Marseilles, France, has published data showing that out of 80 mild COVID-19 patients treated with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin, 93 percent had no detectable levels of the virus after eight days.Doctors have questioned the value of the Marseille study and several papers from China as being too small or poorly designed to offer hard evidence of benefit. Most do not compare outcomes of patients who received the malaria therapies with people who did not, considered the most reliable measure of a drug’s effectiveness. Last week, doctors in Paris reported that they tried to replicate the results of the Marseille study and failed. Results from a trial conducted in Wuhan, China, were released that included a control group of patients who did not receive the anti-malarial therapy for comparison. But critics questioned why information on the trial’s main goal -- detecting viral load -- was not disclosed, and said data was missing for some patients. More rigorous U.S.-led trials are now underway. But most focus on whether the drugs can help prevent illness in people exposed to the coronavirus, such as healthcare workers or relatives of confirmed patients, and not people who are already sick. Randomized, controlled trials of the drugs are being conducted in other countries, including China, Brazil and Norway.Until the evidence is in, “each institution is setting their own treatment guidelines,” said Dr Otto Yang, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, Los Angeles Medical Center. “There is simply no data,” he said. “It is a matter of opinion, and opinions differ.”Trump is deeply invested in the idea that the malaria drugs will show a benefit, and personally pressured federal health officials to make them available, Reuters reported on Saturday. The president announced on Twitter last month that hydroxychloroquine, when combined with azithromycin, has the potential to become “one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.”In late March, the Department of Health and Human Services accepted donations of millions of doses of the drugs from manufacturers Novartis AG and Bayer AG. “President Trump is taking every possible step to protect Americans from the coronavirus and provide them with hope,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in announcing delivery of the doses to the U.S. Strategic National Stockpile, which houses medical and other supplies needed to address pandemics or biological threats.Several of Trump’s top health officials, including Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, frequently caution that it is too early to promote hydroxychloroquine until results from more rigorous trials are available. While some studies suggest a benefit, “we’ve got to be careful that we don’t make that majestic leap to assume that this is a knockout drug,” Fauci told cable network Fox News on Friday.The Food and Drug Administration has not approved hydroxychloroquine as a COVID-19 treatment, but the agency has provided an emergency use authorization for the anti-malarial drugs to be used in clinical trials or for hospitalized patients when a doctor deems it appropriate.“We have not taken a stance, nor are we, on whether doctors should prescribe it,” FDA Commissioner Dr Stephen Hahn told Fox News last week. “We’re providing facts and information about the risks and benefits, but that really is and should be a doctor-patient decision.”The sudden, unexpected surge in demand for the drugs to treat coronavirus is coming at a cost to the many patients who take them regularly to treat the debilitating symptoms of autoimmune disorders like lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.Within hours of Trump’s initial endorsement on March 19, pharmaceutical supply chain experts reported shortages as doctors began prescribing hydroxychloroquine for themselves and their families. Vizient Inc, which works with about half of the country’s hospitals to buy drugs, told Reuters that orders for hydroxychloroquine jumped to around 1.8 million tablets per day in late March, up from an average of around 40,000 tablets per day in late January.“For many lupus patients, (hydroxychloroquine) is a life saver,” patient advocacy group Lupus LA wrote in an emailed statement. “These patients are now having trouble accessing their medication, putting them in a dire situation.”Several U.S. states and health insurers are taking steps to limit prescriptions, while Trump issued an executive order on March 23 to keep Americans from hoarding or price gouging.While the antimalarial approach, and its vocal advocates, are dominating headlines, doctors are still hopeful that one or more of the other therapies being tested will begin to show success.UCLA and Northwell are among more than three dozen medical centers participating in clinical trials of Gilead Science’s experimental antiviral remdesivir, which was previously tested as a treatment for Ebola but failed to show effectiveness. Initial data from a separate trial of the drug in China could be announced this month.“We feel like the hierarchy in terms of the evidence to support its use starts with remdesivir, then to hydroxychloroquine, and then it sort of rapidly deteriorates after that,” said Dr Arun Sanyal, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University School of Medicine.Some are keen to see whether blood plasma from recovered coronavirus patients will spur immunity in others -- a method used more than 100 years ago. The FDA recently authorized expanded use of such donated plasma by hospitals across the country. McQuillen of Lahey Hospital said that approach has a good chance of succeeding.Others have focused on the potential of more advanced biologic medicines to quell the processes that put the body’s immune system into overdrive in severe COVID-19 cases.In fighting off the virus, the immune systems of these patients set off a so-called “cytokine storm,” releasing molecules into the blood that can cause dangerously high blood pressure, lung damage and eventual organ failure.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi SA are testing the arthritis drug Kevzara, or sarilumab. Roche has begun trials of Actemra, also known as tocilizumab. Both of them are interleukin-6 inhibitors, as is clazakizumab, under development by privately-held biotech Vitaeris Inc.Novartis plans a study of its drug Jakavi, or ruxolitinib, which can also help dial down a cytokine storm, in severe cases of COVID-19.“That’s where you’re going to see the most trials in the next month or two,” said Dr Kevin Tracey, CEO of Northwell Health’s research arm. “There are a lot of drugs that target the body’s reaction, rather than the virus itself.”"
2020-4-08,Novavax to start human trial for novel coronavirus vaccine,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN21Q1BC,"(Reuters) - Novavax Inc said on Wednesday it had identified a novel coronavirus vaccine candidate and would start human trials in mid-May.The Maryland-based late-stage biotechnology company said its Matrix-M adjuvant would be used with the vaccine candidate - NVX-CoV2373 - to enhance immune responses.Adjuvants are mainly used to enable a vaccine to induce a strong immune response including a greater production of antibodies and longer-lasting protection against viral and bacterial infections.Novavax said preliminary immunogenicity and safety results from the trial were expected in July.It joins at least a dozen other drugmakers working on vaccines, antivirals and other treatments to help those infected with the fast-spreading respiratory virus, with some antivirals already being used in trials.Highly anticipated data for a Gilead Sciences Inc experimental antiviral drug are expected later this month.Analysts are also awaiting results in the near term for products already approved for other conditions from companies such as Roche Holding and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc.While experts estimate an approved vaccine could be at least a year away, progress toward treatments that benefit some COVID-19 patients could help investors gauge when the epidemic could come under control and some economic activity might resume.Studies are also ongoing for hydroxychloroquine, a decades-old malaria drug that has been used by doctors for COVID-19, despite disagreements about its effectiveness.More than 1.34 million people have been reported infected by the coronavirus across the world and 76,043 have died, according to a Reuters tally."

2020-4-09,Data on arthritis drug to treat coronavirus could come within weeks -Regeneron exec,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2BX14O,"(Reuters) - Initial data from clinical trials testing whether patients with severe coronavirus illness can be helped by a rheumatoid arthritis drug sold by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA may come as early as next week, Regeneron’s chief scientific officer told Reuters.“We could be one to two weeks - at most a month or so - away from knowing whether this is really making a difference or not,” George Yancopoulos said of the drug Kevzara in a video interview on Wednesday ahead of a Reuters Events pharmaceutical conference next week.The U.S. biotech company is also working to develop a drug made from antibodies from humans and mice that could be used for treatment or prevention of COVID-19, the highly contagious respiratory disease caused by the novel coronavirus. That could be in clinical trials by June, said Yancopoulos, who co-founded Regeneron with Chief Executive Len Schleifer.Kevzara belongs to a class of drugs known as interleukin-6 inhibitors that could help regulate an overreaction to the virus by the body’s immune system called a cytokine storm, which may be triggering the respiratory distress seen in severe COVID-19 cases.Because of that, the drug is being tested on severe cases of the disease, which has killed some 90,000 people and wreaked havoc on economies around the world.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration encouraged Regeneron and Sanofi to combine planned mid- and late-stage clinical trials of Kevzara into a single study to speed the process, Yancopoulos said.The companies should know if they are a seeing a strong signal on whether the drug works after a few weeks of enrolling patients, he said. The U.S. Kevzara trial started on March 16.If the drug proves effective, supply should not be an issue, Yancopoulos said, noting that as many as a million doses have already been produced with the capacity to manufacture a lot more.“This is treating the small percentage of people who end up being hospitalized and going on ventilators and so forth,” he said. “So there would be reasonable amounts of drug available.”Meanwhile, Regeneron recently isolated hundreds of virus-neutralizing antibodies from genetically-modified mice and from humans who have recovered from COVID-19 and is working to select the best two candidates for a therapy that might treat and even prevent the disease.The company used a similar approach to develop a treatment for Ebola. That drug has not yet been fully evaluated by health regulators, but was shown in clinical trials to cut mortality nearly by half.“It’s a bridge, ultimately, to the vaccine... something that we can do in the short term,” Yancopoulos said. “We can maybe do it actually more powerfully than a vaccine can do it, though for a smaller targeted population than a vaccine can reach.”He said Regeneron is working with the FDA to repurpose its upstate New York manufacturing facility to become totally dedicated to producing drugs for the pandemic. It could make “hundreds of thousands, if not on the order of a million doses a month” of the antibody cocktail there.Other companies have approached Regeneron about helping produce massive quantities of the antibody therapy should it prove effective in preventing COVID-19, Yancopoulos said.“If these things work, let’s make sure we can put as much manufacturing capacity as we can on it right now,” he said."

2020-4-13,"RPT-Wall St Week Ahead-Health, tech, staples could shine through earnings gloom",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2C10JX,"(Repeats item originally published on April 9, no change to content)NEW YORK, April 13 (Reuters) - As U.S. companies gear up for what may be the gloomiest reporting period since the financial crisis, the consumer staples, health care and technology sectors could be comparative bright spots.Most sectors are expected to bring dire news this earnings season in the wake of the U.S. coronavirus outbreak, which has produced the most cases of any country. Economists widely expect a severe economic downturn as a result.Given the outbreak is expected to have hampered a broad swath of the economy in the first quarter, analysts are forecasting an 8.1% drop in earnings from the previous year, down from estimated profit growth of 6.3% at the start of the year, according to IBES data from Refinitiv. That would be the biggest earnings decline since the third quarter of 2009, when profits fell 14.7% from a year earlier.Moreover, a number of companies have pulled guidance for the quarter, raising worries that analysts’ forecasts for the period may underestimate the extent of the fallout from the virus.The energy, consumer discretionary and industrials sectors have been cited for the biggest declines in forecasts since Jan. 1, and investors have been bracing for especially poor results from travel, entertainment, energy and discretionary companies in general.The S&P Composite 1500 airlines index, for instance, remains down 51.8% since Feb. 19, when the benchmark S&P 500 ended its nearly 11-year bull market and coronavirus fears sparked a deep sell-off on Wall Street. The S&P 500 is down 17.6% since that date.Estimates for technology, communication services, health care, consumer staples and utilities have fallen as well, but all of those sectors still are expected to post some profit gains for the quarter, based on Refinitiv’s data.Analysts see quarterly earnings in the technology sector up 2.6% from 2019, communication services up 7.8%, utilities up 2.3%, health care up 1.6% and consumer staples up 0.9%.Technology’s relatively high cash balances and lower debt make it “a rare cyclical safe-haven,” said Daniel Morgan, vice president and senior portfolio manager at Synovus Trust Company in Atlanta, Georgia.That is due in part to software spending, which has been resilient, said Morgan, who lists Microsoft, Nvidia and Citrix Systems among his top 10 picks of stocks likely to hold up better than others this earnings season.“You’re going to continue to see companies trying to streamline to become more productive. That trend to me is still intact,” he said.Morgan also likes stocks in health care like Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and in staples, such as Clorox Co. .The rush to stock up on household items like toilet paper and cleaing materials has driven up shares of staples companies since the outbreak, which began in China late last year and then spread through Europe and the United States.“Kimberly-Clark is the one that leaps to mind,” said Kim Forrest, chief investment officer at Bokeh Capital Partners in Pittsburgh, referring to companies that have held up. Shares of Kimberly-Clark Corp surged following the outbreak but are down 8.5% since Feb. 19.To be sure, some companies whose shares have outperformed may end up reporting lackluster reports. That is especially a hazard for grocery chains, according to Forrest. “The stuff that people are snapping up is the low-margin stuff.

2020-4-13,"Reasons for hope: the drugs, tests and tactics that may conquer coronavirus",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2C116M,"April 13 (Reuters) - With much of the world living in lockdown, the spread of the new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, that was first detected in China late last year is beginning to slow in some places. As of April 12, 1.8 million had been infected and 115,000 killed by COVID-19, the disease caused by the virus.While a safe, effective vaccine is still more than a year away, researchers are rushing to repurpose existing drugs and non-drug therapies as well as testing promising experimental drugs that were already in clinical trials.Even moderately effective therapies or combinations could dramatically reduce the crushing demand on hospitals and intensive care units, changing the nature of the risk the new pathogen represents to populations and healthcare systems. New drugs, together with new diagnostics, antibody tests, patient- and contact-tracing technologies, disease surveillance and other early-warning tools, mean the anticipated next “wave” of the global pandemic does not have to be nearly as bad the first.More than 70 vaccine candidates are also in development around the world, with at least five in preliminary testing in people. Here are some of the drugs, vaccines and other therapies in development: *DRUGS* REMDESIVIR - GILEAD SCIENCES Antiviral drug, originally developed to combat RNA viruses including respiratory syncytial virus. At least 13 trials underway in China, Europe and the U.S. with preliminary results from two Chinese trials expected as soon as April 2020. A February assessment by the WHO flagged this candidate as the most promising for battling COVID-19. CAVEATS: Initial data are expected to come from studies of patients with relatively severe COVID-19. Because antivirals work best when patients are healthier, those results may show limited effectiveness.

The method has been used for more than 100 years and carries little risk of harm or side effects. Small case studies suggest it may help reduce virus levels, and controlled trials are in progress in China, Europe and the United States to gather stronger evidence for a benefit. Results published in April from a study in 10 patients with severe illness in China found significant improvement compared to similar patients who did not receive the treatment. CAVEATS: Immediately available and already in limited use, but supply of plasma from recovered patients may not be sufficient to meet all needs.

A multicenter Phase 1/2 trial in 90 patients is testing whether this cell therapy can prevent the SARS-CoV-2 virus from entering cells and multiplying, and will look at efficacy over 28 days in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 pneumonia. STATUS: Experimental EARLY RESULTS: 0-3 months ------ *TESTING* SEROLOGY/ANTIBODY TESTING Governments and academic groups have started to test blood for antibodies indicating that a person has been exposed to the new virus, with or without showing symptoms. The presence of antibodies indicates past infection, but separate, ongoing research is needed to know what type and concentration of virus-neutralizing antibodies protect against a new infection, whether all infections produce a full antibody response, and how long protection might last. Wide serology testing for antibodies will soon provide a broader understanding of the scope and dynamics of the pandemic, help identify which recovered patients may have some immunity to reinfection and for how long, and also help identify the neutralizing antibodies that could become templates for monoclonal antibody therapies as well as models for desired responses from a vaccine candidate. Data from serology testing are expected to begin appearing within weeks. CAVEATS: Early data on COVID-19 patients in China suggests that they develop varying amounts of antibodies in response to infection. One pre-publication report analyzed plasma from 175 patients and found that a sign of inflammation correlated with higher antibody titers and that younger patients were less likely to produce large amounts of antibodies. Experts think instances of ""reinfection"" in recovered patients are more likely relapses in patients whose bodies had not cleared the virus. Data is still lacking on whether mild or symptomless infections generate meaningful antibody responses or protection.

2020-4-26,"ANALYSIS-Investors bet on testing, treatments for restart of U.S. economy",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2CE09Y,"(Reuters) - Investors are pinning their hopes for the reopening of the U.S. economy on the potential for wider availability of testing for COVID-19 cases and on drug trials for treatments of the deadly disease but said, until there is concrete progress in these areas, further stock market gains may be limited.Much of the S&P 500's .SPX almost 27% advance above its March 23 low has been due to hopes that massive U.S. fiscal and monetary support would dampen the economic blow from stay-at-home orders designed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.But recently, the index has reacted to reports about trials and in particular Gilead Science's GILD.O remdesivir experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to keep a virus from replicating and overwhelming a patient's immune system.This volatility highlights investor impatience for indications of when state and Federal authorities might start to ease stay-at-home orders and get people back to work.So far there are no approved treatments or vaccines for the disease which has killed over 190,000 people globally, according to a Reuters tally. The disease has infected more than 928,000 people and killed more than 52,000 in the United States alone, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Any sentiment around a therapy is really moving markets because it shapes expectations for a return to normalcy which would be needed to get an economic recovery started,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.The S&P added to gains on Friday after the lead investigator in a U.S. government trial of remdesivir told Reuters the trial may yield results as early as mid-May.But on Thursday the index temporarily pared gains after a report Gilead’s drug failed a trial the drugmaker itself deemed inconclusive because the study was ended early. On April 17 investors were encouraged after medical news publication STAT reported rapid improvements in COVID-19 patients in one hospital studying the drug.While Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut is encouraged by the number of researchers working on coronavirus treatments, he is cautious about the stock market’s near-term prospects.“The only thing that pushes us above this range in a sustainable way is a therapeutic solution or a vaccine that allows us to return to the pre-crisis level of business,” he said. “I think we’ll get a medical solution. The big question is the time frame. The longer it takes it becomes harder (for the economy) to snap back and rebound.”While there are more than 70 vaccines in development for coronavirus, Manulife Investment Management’s Steven Slaughter, who manages a roughly $3.5 billion dedicated healthcare fund said he expects development of a successful vaccine to take at least 12-18 months compared to the average vaccine development time of 5-7 years.Then it could be years before pharmaceutical companies can produce enough to vaccinate the world’s entire population.But Slaughter is optimistic at least some treatment will be validated in trials in the next three to six months, and said this would give officials “more latitude to restart the economy.”He said there are four main types of treatments being tested by companies including Gilead, Takeda Pharmaceutical 4502.T, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O and Alexion Pharmaceuticals ALXN.O that all hold some promise. While treatments may not necessarily slow transmission of the disease, they could help doctors control the severity of infections, easing pressure on intensive care units (ICU).“If we can take a patient that otherwise would’ve spend 2-3 weeks in an ICU bed out of that ICU bed in 2-3 days that has an enormous beneficial impact on our ability to handle outbreaks or to handle a potential second wave of infections,” he said.In the meantime officials should at least look for greater availability of tests that can detect virus infections and for ways to track and trace people who might have been exposed, before easing lockdowns, some strategists said.""What will be more critical will be the testing capacity and the efficacy of track and trace programmes,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Management.

Against that, many more U.S. states were looking to reopen businesses.Boeing Co gained 1.6% in premarket trading after it pulled out of a $4.2 billion deal to buy Brazil planemaker Embraer’s commercial jets division over the weekend.“It’s very promising what we are now seeing ... including the fact that states in the U.S and countries across Europe are starting to at least plan for the lifting of restrictions,” said Craig Erlam, analyst at OANDA in London.With the Bank of Japan weighing in with more stimulus on Monday, focus this week will be on the Federal Reserve’s meeting ending on Wednesday, although expectations are low for more easing by the U.S. central bank.At 7:58 a.m. ET, Dow e-minis were up 219 points, or 0.93%, S&P 500 e-minis were up 26 points, or 0.92% and Nasdaq 100 e-minis were up 109.25 points, or 1.25%.About 173 companies in the S&P 500 are scheduled to report quarterly earnings this week, including Apple, Amazon.com, Microsoft, Boeing, Ford , General Electric and Chevron.Overall, analysts expect a decline of nearly 15% in first-quarter earnings of S&P 500 companies, with profits for the energy sector estimated to have slumped 68%.Apple gave up some early gains after a report said the company was delaying the production ramp-up of its flagship iPhones coming later this year by about a month.Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc slipped 0.2% after the U.S. drugmaker and France’s Sanofi SA said they would continue a late-stage trial of their arthritis drug, Kevzara, in only COVID-19 patients who are critical, and discontinued the trial for those in the “severe” group.

This 3% increase was the highest since April 14.The number of probable cases in nursing homes was more or less stable at 37,503, giving an overall total of confirmed and probable cases of 165,842 cases.In its statement, the Health Ministry also mentioned “promising results” in a clinical trial, led by Paris University Hospital AP-HP, involving tocilizumab, which is used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.The 129 patients involved in the trial were selected on the basis of hospitalisation for moderate or severe COVID-19 pneumonia, but did not require resuscitation at the time of admission.“It has been established that the patients treated with tocilizumab showed a lesser need of ventilation and a lesser death rate after 14 days of treatment,” the health ministry said, adding the results would be submitted for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.“The is the first tested drug where a positive effect is seen in a clinical trial.”Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O and Sanofi SASY.PA said on Monday the results of a study of their rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara indicated it may only help the sickest coronavirus patients, dampening hopes the medicine could benefit a wider group of those infected.

2020-4-27,"RPT-ANALYSIS-Investors bet on testing, treatments for restart of U.S. economy",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2CF00U,"(Repeats story published on Sunday, with no change to text)April 26 (Reuters) - Investors are pinning their hopes for the reopening of the U.S. economy on the potential for wider availability of testing for COVID-19 cases and on drug trials for treatments of the deadly disease but said, until there is concrete progress in these areas, further stock market gains may be limited.Much of the S&P 500’s almost 27% advance above its March 23 low has been due to hopes that massive U.S. fiscal and monetary support would dampen the economic blow from stay-at-home orders designed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.But recently, the index has reacted to reports about trials and in particular Gilead Science’s remdesivir experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to keep a virus from replicating and overwhelming a patient’s immune system.This volatility highlights investor impatience for indications of when state and Federal authorities might start to ease stay-at-home orders and get people back to work.So far there are no approved treatments or vaccines for the disease which has killed over 190,000 people globally, according to a Reuters tally. The disease has infected more than 928,000 people and killed more than 52,000 in the United States alone, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Any sentiment around a therapy is really moving markets because it shapes expectations for a return to normalcy which would be needed to get an economic recovery started,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.The S&P added to gains on Friday after the lead investigator in a U.S. government trial of remdesivir told Reuters the trial may yield results as early as mid-May.But on Thursday the index temporarily pared gains after a report Gilead’s drug failed a trial the drugmaker itself deemed inconclusive because the study was ended early. On April 17 investors were encouraged after medical news publication STAT reported rapid improvements in COVID-19 patients in one hospital studying the drug.While Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut is encouraged by the number of researchers working on coronavirus treatments, he is cautious about the stock market’s near-term prospects.“The only thing that pushes us above this range in a sustainable way is a therapeutic solution or a vaccine that allows us to return to the pre-crisis level of business,” he said. “I think we’ll get a medical solution. The big question is the time frame. The longer it takes it becomes harder (for the economy) to snap back and rebound.”While there are more than 70 vaccines in development for coronavirus, Manulife Investment Management’s Steven Slaughter, who manages a roughly $3.5 billion dedicated healthcare fund said he expects development of a successful vaccine to take at least 12-18 months compared to the average vaccine development time of 5-7 years.Then it could be years before pharmaceutical companies can produce enough to vaccinate the world’s entire population.But Slaughter is optimistic at least some treatment will be validated in trials in the next three to six months, and said this would give officials “more latitude to restart the economy.”He said there are four main types of treatments being tested by companies including Gilead, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Alexion Pharmaceuticals that all hold some promise.While treatments may not necessarily slow transmission of the disease, they could help doctors control the severity of infections, easing pressure on intensive care units (ICU).“If we can take a patient that otherwise would’ve spend 2-3 weeks in an ICU bed out of that ICU bed in 2-3 days that has an enormous beneficial impact on our ability to handle outbreaks or to handle a potential second wave of infections,” he said.In the meantime officials should at least look for greater availability of tests that can detect virus infections and for ways to track and trace people who might have been exposed, before easing lockdowns, some strategists said.“What will be more critical will be the testing capacity and the efficacy of track and trace programmes,” said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Management. Test developers include Abbott Laboratories and Roche Holding.Since much of the U.S. population has been told to stay at home and many businesses have been on pause since the middle of March, investors have already accounted for dismal earnings and a massive U.S. economic decline in the second quarter.But recent S&P gains seem to imply a huge improvement in the economy in the third quarter, according to Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.“There will be a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19 but people are underestimating the amount of time it takes for them to reach the market,” said Tuz. “If there are disappointments in three areas - vaccine, treatment and testing - we could back track some in the market.” (Reporting by Sinéad Carew in New York; Additional reporting by Sujata Rao-Coverly and Tommy Reggiori Wilkes in London; Editing by Alden Bentley)"

2020-4-27,"Regeneron, Sanofi arthritis drug may only help critical coronavirus patients: study",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2291OD,"(Reuters) - Results of a study of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara indicate it may only help the sickest coronavirus patients, the companies said on Monday, dampening hopes the medicine could benefit a wider group of those infected.The drugmakers said they would continue to test high doses of Kevzara only in those who are considered critically ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the highly contagious virus. The decision was based on guidance from an independent committee that reviewed early trial data, which showed it did not help patients deemed severely ill.Patients who required mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy or treatment in an intensive care unit were considered critically ill. Those who required oxygen without mechanical or high-flow oxygenation were considered severely ill.There are currently no approved treatments specifically for the novel coronavirus, so drugmakers are rushing to test existing medicines as well as experimental therapies in the hope that something will help alter the course of the illness that has infected more than 3 million people and killed over 208,000 worldwide.Regeneron co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said he was skeptical about the prospect of drugs like Kevzara that were not designed to treat COVID-19. Drugs currently in late stage testing for the virus, like Gilead Science’s remdesivir, were developed for other diseases.“Repurposing a drug and finding it to be very effective for a new indication is an exception, as opposed to the rule,” Yancopoulos said. “It’s very, very rare where those have really turned into important drugs for whole new indication.“It’s hard enough to design a drug and get it to work,” he added.Regeneron has identified hundreds of virus-neutralizing antibodies and is working to select the best two candidates for a “cocktail” therapy that might treat and even prevent COVID-19, with the expectation of starting human trials in June.Kevzara belongs to a class of drugs called interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors that could help regulate a dangerous overreaction to the virus by the body’s immune system called a “cytokine storm,” which may be triggering the respiratory distress seen in severe COVID-19 cases.Early analysis of the study showed Kevzara rapidly lowered levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. However, the companies reported negative trends for most “severely” ill patients given the drug, while there were positive trends in the critically ill group.Researchers were looking for reductions in risk of death and need for a ventilator, as well as clinical improvements such as ability to come off oxygen therapy or be discharged from the hospital. Those who received the higher tested dose of Kevzara (400 milligrams) appeared to fare better among the critically ill group.Dr. Kevin Tracey, head of research at New York hospital group Northwell Health which participated in the trial, cautioned against drawing strong conclusions on the use of IL-6 inhibitors for COVID-19.Different compounds that work similarly could be more effective, he said in a phone interview, noting that rheumatoid arthritis treatments from another class of drugs may help one patient with the condition but not another.“Scientifically, we don’t know why,” he said. “I wouldn’t draw any conclusions negatively or positively until the results of the randomized clinical trials are in of the particular agents.”Also on Monday, French researchers said Roche Holding AG’s IL-6 inhibitor Actemra significantly reduced the risk of death and the number of patients needing a ventilator in a study 129 COVID-19 patients. However, full data from that study has not yet been released or peer reviewed.Regeneron shares, which have risen nearly 50% so far this year, closed down 3.3% at $547.52."

2020-4-27,Medicamento para artritis de Regeneron solo ayudar\xc3\xada a pacientes cr\xc3\xadticos de coronavirus: estudio,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2CF1AG,"27 abr (Reuters) - Los resultados de un estudio sobre la medicina para la artritis reumatoide Kevzara, de Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc y Sanofi SA, indican que sólo ayudaría a pacientes críticos de coronavirus, informaron el lunes las compañías.Las farmacéuticas dijeron que seguirán probando altas dosis de Kevzara en quienes sean considerados como enfermos críticos de COVID-19, la enfermedad causada por el altamente contagioso coronavirus. La decisión se basó en recomendaciones de un comité independiente que revisó datos de un ensayo inicial que mostró que no beneficia a enfermos considerados graves.Los pacientes que necesitan ventilación mecánica, terapia de alto flujo de oxígeno o tratamiento en una unidad de cuidados intensivos fueron considerados críticos. Aquellos que requieren oxígeno sin ventilación mecánica u oxigenación de alto flujo fueron considerados enfermos graves.Actualmente no hay tratamientos aprobados específicamente para el nuevo coronavirus, por lo que las farmacéuticas están probando medicamentos existentes y terapias experimentales con la esperanza de que ayuden a alterar el curso de la enfermedad, que ha infectado a más de tres millones de personas y matado a más de 208.000 en todo el mundo.Kevzara pertenece a una clase de medicamentos llamados inhibidores de la interleucina-6 (IL-6) que podrían ayudar a regular una peligrosa sobrerreacción del sistema inmune al virus llamada “tormenta de citoquinas”, que podría causar los problemas respiratorios vistos en los casos severos de COVID-19.Análisis iniciales del estudio mostraron que Kevzara redujo rápidamente los niveles de proteína C reactiva, un indicador de inflamación. Sin embargo, las compañías reportaron tendencias negativas en la mayoría de los pacientes “gravemente” enfermos que recibieron el medicamento, mientras que hubo tendencias positivas en el grupo de enfermos críticos.Los investigadores buscaron reducciones en el riesgo de muerte y la necesidad de un ventilador, así como mejorías clínicas como la capacidad de salir de la terapia de oxígeno o el alta hospitalaria. Quienes recibieron la dosis más alta probada de Kevzara (400 miligramos) parecieron reaccionar mejor en el grupo de enfermos críticos.El médico Kevin Tracey, jefe de investigación del grupo hospitalario de Nueva York Northwell Health que participó del estudio, advirtió no sacar conclusiones firmes sobre el uso de inhibidores de IL-6 en pacientes con COVID-19.Diferentes compuestos que funcionan de manera similar podrían ser más efectivos, dijo en una entrevista telefónica, destacando que los tratamientos para la artritis reumatoide con otra clase de medicamentos podrían ayudar a un paciente con la condición, pero no a otro.“Científicamente, desconocemos la razón”, afirmó. “No sacaría ninguna conclusión positiva ni negativa hasta que se conozcan los resultados de las pruebas clínicas randomizadas de los agentes particulares”, agregó.Los resultados mixtos de Kevzara plantean preocupaciones de que el beneficio en los pacientes críticos de COVID-19 pueda ser una conclusión engañosa y que no indique un provecho real, dijo el analista Kennen MacKay de RBC Capital Markets.

2020-4-27,AN\xc3\x81LISIS-Inversores apuestan a que pruebas y tratamientos pondr\xc3\xa1n en marcha la econom\xc3\xada de EEUU,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSXXN2CF006,"27 abr (Reuters) - Los inversores ponen sus esperanzas de que la economía de Estados Unidos vuelva a abrir en el potencial de una mayor disponibilidad de pruebas para los casos de COVID-19 y en medicamentos para tratar la enfermedad mortal, pero dicen que hasta que haya un avance concreto en estas áreas, un alza del mercado bursátil estará limitada.Gran parte del avance de del S&P 500 por encima del mínimo del 23 de marzo se debe a la esperanza de que el masivo apoyo fiscal y monetario en Estados Unidos amortigüe el impacto de las medidas de confinamiento, pensadas para contener la pandemia de coronavirus.Pero recientemente el índice ha reaccionado a informes sobre pruebas clínicas y, en particular, al tratamiento experimental remdesivir de Gilead Science para el COVID-19, la enfermedad respiratoria causada por el nuevo coronavirus.Remdesivir, que antes fue un fracaso como tratamiento para el ébola, está diseñado para evitar que un virus se replique y abrume el sistema inmunológico del paciente.La volatilidad de los mercados pone de manifiesto la impaciencia de los inversores, que esperan señales de las autoridades estatales y federales sobre cuándo comenzarán a aliviar las restricciones y permitir que las personas vuelvan a trabajar.Hasta ahora no hay tratamientos o vacunas aprobados para la enfermedad que ha matado a más de 200.000 personas en el mundo, según un recuento de Reuters. (Evolución del coronavirus: reut.rs/2Yc2Jw2)La enfermedad ha infectado a más de 928.000 personas y ha matado a más de 52.000 solo en Estados Unidos, según los últimos datos de los Centros para el Control y la Prevención de Enfermedades. (El coronavirus en Estados Unidos: reut.rs/2WVPxuE)“Cualquier mención a una terapia está moviendo los mercados porque da forma a las expectativas de un retorno a la normalidad, que sería necesario para comenzar una recuperación económica”, dijo Shawn Cruz, gerente de estrategia comercial de TD Ameritrade.El S&P subió el viernes después de que el investigador principal en una prueba con remdesivir del gobierno de Estados Unidos dijo a Reuters que puede haber resultados incluso a mediados de mayo.Sin embargo, el índice había recortado temporalmente las ganancias después de un informe de que el medicamento, de Gilead Sciences, fracasó en una prueba que el mismo fabricante consideró no concluyente porque el estudio terminó antes de tiempo.Si bien Michael O’Rourke, estratega jefe de mercado de JonesTrading en Stamford, Connecticut, se siente alentado por la cantidad de investigadores que trabajan en tratamientos para el coronavirus, es cauto sobre las perspectivas de corto plazo en el mercado de valores.“Lo único que nos empujará por encima de este rango de manera sostenible es una solución terapéutica o una vacuna que nos permita volver al nivel de negocios anterior a la crisis”, dijo.“Creo que habrá una solución médica. La gran pregunta es el marco de tiempo. Cuanto más se demore, será más difícil (para la economía) recuperarse”.Si bien hay más de 70 vacunas en desarrollo para el coronavirus, Steven Slaughter de Manulife Investment Management, que administra un fondo de atención médica de aproximadamente 3.500 millones de dólares, dijo que espera que el desarrollo de una vacuna exitosa demore al menos entre 12 y 18 meses, en comparación con el tiempo promedio de desarrollo de 5 a 7 años.Además, podrían pasar años antes de que las compañías farmacéuticas puedan producir las suficientes para vacunar a toda la población mundial.Pero Slaughter es optimista y cree que al menos algún tratamiento será validado en pruebas en los próximos tres a seis meses, y dijo que esto les daría a los funcionarios “más libertad para reabrir la economía”.El analista dijo que hay cuatro tipos principales de tratamientos, que están probando compañías como Gilead, Takeda Pharmaceutical, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals y Alexion Pharmaceuticals, que son prometedores.Si bien los tratamientos pueden no necesariamente retrasar la transmisión de la enfermedad, podrían ayudar a los médicos a controlar la gravedad de las infecciones, aliviando la presión sobre las unidades de cuidados intensivos (UCI).“Si podemos sacar a un paciente que de otra manera hubiera pasado dos a tres semanas en una cama de la UCI fuera de esa cama en dos a tres días, eso tendría un enorme impacto beneficioso en nuestra capacidad para manejar brotes o una posible segunda ola de infecciones”, dijo.Mientras tanto, los funcionarios deberían al menos tratar de tener más pruebas que puedan detectar infecciones de virus y formas de rastrear a las personas que podrían haber estado expuestas, antes de levantar las restricciones, dijeron algunos estrategas.“Lo que será más crítico será la capacidad de prueba y la eficacia de los programas de seguimiento y localización”, dijo Salman Ahmed, estratega jefe de inversiones de Lombard Odier Investment Management."
2020-4-27,"Regeneron, Sanofi arthritis drug may only help critical coronavirus patients -study",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N2CF36U,"(Reuters) - Results of a study of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara indicate it may only help the sickest coronavirus patients, the companies said on Monday, dampening hopes the medicine could benefit a wider group of those infected.The drugmakers said they would continue to test high doses of Kevzara only in those who are considered critically ill with COVID-19, the disease caused by the highly contagious virus. The decision was based on guidance from an independent committee that reviewed early trial data, which showed it did not help patients deemed severely ill.Patients who required mechanical ventilation or high-flow oxygen therapy or treatment in an intensive care unit were considered critically ill. Those who required oxygen without mechanical or high-flow oxygenation were considered severely ill.There are currently no approved treatments specifically for the novel coronavirus, so drugmakers are rushing to test existing medicines as well as experimental therapies in the hope that something will help alter the course of the illness that has infected more than 3 million people and killed over 208,000 worldwide.Regeneron co-founder and Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said he was skeptical about the prospect of drugs like Kevzara that were not designed to treat COVID-19. Drugs currently in late stage testing for the virus, like Gilead Science’s remdesivir, were developed for other diseases.“Repurposing a drug and finding it to be very effective for a new indication is an exception, as opposed to the rule,” Yancopoulos said. “It’s very, very rare where those have really turned into important drugs for whole new indication.“It’s hard enough to design a drug and get it to work,” he added.Regeneron has identified hundreds of virus-neutralizing antibodies and is working to select the best two candidates for a “cocktail” therapy that might treat and even prevent COVID-19, with the expectation of starting human trials in June.Kevzara belongs to a class of drugs called interleukin-6 (IL-6) inhibitors that could help regulate a dangerous overreaction to the virus by the body’s immune system called a “cytokine storm,” which may be triggering the respiratory distress seen in severe COVID-19 cases.Early analysis of the study showed Kevzara rapidly lowered levels of C-reactive protein, a marker of inflammation. However, the companies reported negative trends for most “severely” ill patients given the drug, while there were positive trends in the critically ill group.Researchers were looking for reductions in risk of death and need for a ventilator, as well as clinical improvements such as ability to come off oxygen therapy or be discharged from the hospital. Those who received the higher tested dose of Kevzara (400 milligrams) appeared to fare better among the critically ill group.Dr. Kevin Tracey, head of research at New York hospital group Northwell Health which participated in the trial, cautioned against drawing strong conclusions on the use of IL-6 inhibitors for COVID-19.Different compounds that work similarly could be more effective, he said in a phone interview, noting that rheumatoid arthritis treatments from another class of drugs may help one patient with the condition but not another.“Scientifically, we don’t know why,” he said. “I wouldn’t draw any conclusions negatively or positively until the results of the randomized clinical trials are in of the particular agents.”Also on Monday, French researchers said Roche Holding AG’s IL-6 inhibitor Actemra significantly reduced the risk of death and the number of patients needing a ventilator in a study 129 COVID-19 patients. However, full data from that study has not yet been released or peer reviewed.Regeneron shares, which have risen nearly 50% so far this year, closed down 3.3% at $547.52."

2020-4-27,"Investors bet on testing, treatments for restart of U.S. economy",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN229021,"(Reuters) - Investors are pinning their hopes for the reopening of the U.S. economy on the potential for wider availability of testing for COVID-19 cases and on drug trials for treatments of the deadly disease but said, until there is concrete progress in these areas, further stock market gains may be limited.Much of the S&P 500's .SPX almost 27% advance above its March 23 low has been due to hopes that massive U.S. fiscal and monetary support would dampen the economic blow from stay-at-home orders designed to contain the coronavirus pandemic.But recently, the index has reacted to reports about trials and in particular Gilead Science's GILD.O remdesivir experimental treatment for COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the new coronavirus. Remdesivir, which previously failed as a treatment for Ebola, is designed to keep a virus from replicating and overwhelming a patient's immune system.This volatility highlights investor impatience for indications of when state and Federal authorities might start to ease stay-at-home orders and get people back to work.So far there are no approved treatments or vaccines for the disease which has killed over 190,000 people globally, according to a Reuters tally. The disease has infected more than 928,000 people and killed more than 52,000 in the United States alone, according to the latest data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“Any sentiment around a therapy is really moving markets because it shapes expectations for a return to normalcy which would be needed to get an economic recovery started,” said Shawn Cruz, manager of trader strategy at TD Ameritrade in Jersey City, New Jersey.The S&P added to gains on Friday after the lead investigator in a U.S. government trial of remdesivir told Reuters the trial may yield results as early as mid-May.But on Thursday the index temporarily pared gains after a report Gilead’s drug failed a trial the drugmaker itself deemed inconclusive because the study was ended early. On April 17 investors were encouraged after medical news publication STAT reported rapid improvements in COVID-19 patients in one hospital studying the drug.While Michael O’Rourke, chief market strategist at JonesTrading in Stamford, Connecticut is encouraged by the number of researchers working on coronavirus treatments, he is cautious about the stock market’s near-term prospects.“The only thing that pushes us above this range in a sustainable way is a therapeutic solution or a vaccine that allows us to return to the pre-crisis level of business,” he said. “I think we’ll get a medical solution. The big question is the time frame. The longer it takes it becomes harder (for the economy) to snap back and rebound.”While there are more than 70 vaccines in development for coronavirus, Manulife Investment Management’s Steven Slaughter, who manages a roughly $3.5 billion dedicated healthcare fund said he expects development of a successful vaccine to take at least 12-18 months compared to the average vaccine development time of 5-7 years.Then it could be years before pharmaceutical companies can produce enough to vaccinate the world’s entire population.But Slaughter is optimistic at least some treatment will be validated in trials in the next three to six months, and said this would give officials “more latitude to restart the economy.”He said there are four main types of treatments being tested by companies including Gilead, Takeda Pharmaceutical 4502.T, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O and Alexion Pharmaceuticals ALXN.O that all hold some promise. While treatments may not necessarily slow transmission of the disease, they could help doctors control the severity of infections, easing pressure on intensive care units (ICU).“If we can take a patient that otherwise would’ve spend 2-3 weeks in an ICU bed out of that ICU bed in 2-3 days that has an enormous beneficial impact on our ability to handle outbreaks or to handle a potential second wave of infections,” he said.In the meantime officials should at least look for greater availability of tests that can detect virus infections and for ways to track and trace people who might have been exposed, before easing lockdowns, some strategists said.""What will be more critical will be the testing capacity and the efficacy of track and trace programmes,"" said Salman Ahmed, chief investment strategist at Lombard Odier Investment Management. Test developers include Abbott Laboratories ABT.N and Roche Holding ROG.S.Since much of the U.S. population has been told to stay at home and many businesses have been on pause since the middle of March, investors have already accounted for dismal earnings and a massive U.S. economic decline in the second quarter.But recent S&P gains seem to imply a huge improvement in the economy in the third quarter, according to Peter Tuz, president of Chase Investment Counsel in Charlottesville, Virginia.“There will be a vaccine and treatments for COVID-19 but people are underestimating the amount of time it takes for them to reach the market,” said Tuz. “If there are disappointments in three areas - vaccine, treatment and testing - we could back track some in the market.”"

2020-5-08,Sorrento ties up with New York\'s Mount Sinai for COVID-19 antibody cocktail,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN22K1QX,"(Reuters) - Sorrento Therapeutics Inc on Friday partnered with New York City’s Mount Sinai Health System to develop an antibody cocktail to potentially treat or prevent COVID-19, with the aim of starting human trials in the third quarter.There are currently no treatments or vaccines approved for the coronavirus and several drugmakers have been rushing to develop new treatments or repurpose existing drugs to treat patients.Regeneron currently leads the effort to develop an antibody cocktail and has said its experimental therapy may be available for use as early as the end of summer as it ramps up efforts to start human trials in June.The collaboration with Mount Sinai gives Sorrento access to a pool of antibodies against COVID-19 obtained from nearly 15,000 individuals screened by the hospital group.Each dose of the drug candidate would deliver a cocktail of three antibodies, which is expected to provide protection against the virus for up to two months, said Sorrento that markets a non-opioid pain therapy ZTlido.The company is also looking to develop an antibody cocktail that could potentially extend the protective benefit to over a year, Chief Executive Officer Henry Ji told Reuters.Sorrento, which has several treatments in development, including four immuno-oncology therapies, said it is completing the requirements for its application to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to begin early-stage testing in humans."

2020-5-12,Activist investor Elliott pushes Alexion Pharma to sell itself,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2CU343,"(Reuters) - Hedge fund Elliott Management on Tuesday publicly called on Alexion Pharmaceuticals Inc to sell itself, arguing that management’s steps, including recent plans to acquire a smaller company, were leading in the wrong direction.“The best approach for the Company and its stakeholders is the immediate exploration of a sale,” Elliott Associates said in the letter, made public one day before Alexion’s annual shareholder meeting.“The current strategy is unlikely to restore the market’s perceptions of Alexion’s attractiveness and uniqueness,” added Elliott, which manages roughly $40 billion and is one of the world’s most powerful activist investors.Rather than consider a sale, Alexion has been on an acquisition spree, seeking to diversify its research pipeline, deals the hedge fund criticized in the letter.Elliott said it had waited months for CEO Ludwig Hantson's ""go-it-alone"" approach to gain traction and is speaking out now after he announced plans to buy Portola Pharmaceuticals Inc PTLA.O. Alexion shares tumbled on the announcement last week, erasing approximately $1.7 billion from the company's market capitalization in one day. “Such a disproportionate decline in a company’s share price is the sign of much deeper concerns regarding a company’s perceived strategy,” Elliott said in the letter.“Alexion maintains an active dialogue with shareholders and welcomes input and feedback as we execute on our transformation strategy,” a company spokeswoman said in an emailed statement. “We will review the letter issued by Elliott today in due course and expect to continue our constructive dialogue with all of our investors, including Elliott.”Elliott first invested in the rare disease drugmaker in late 2017 and pushed the company to boost its share price. Since then, the company’s share price has remained essentially flat as investors feared competitive threats to its key drug franchise. During that period, shares of large-cap biotechnology peers like Amgen, Regeneron, and Vertex have all risen.Alexion is currently valued at $22 billion, and a sale would be a large deal by the standards of the drug industry, likely reaching more than $40 billion at Tuesday’s share price of $104.92. However, the company has one of the most lucrative drug franchises in the biotechnology industry, which could be attractive to larger players seeking to add billions in cash flow. This year, Alexion has said it expects revenues of $5.2-$5.3 billion.Last year, Celgene Corp and Allergan were acquired in drug industry megadeals after long slumps in each company’s share price.Until now, Elliott and Alexion have held private discussions and this is the second time the hedge fund’s push for a sale has become public. Alexion in December said it rejected Elliott’s suggestions.Elliott was founded in 1977 by billionaire investor Paul Singer and has returned an average 13% a year since then, making it one of the industry’s best performing hedge funds. While it can invest nearly anywhere, it recently devoted significant capital to pushing companies like AT&T, eBay and Twitter to perform better, winning board seats at some.Elliott has praised Alexion’s steps to improve its underlying business but noted its operational improvements have not boosted it in the market.Other shareholders also are concerned about management’s moves, sources familiar with the matter said on Tuesday, adding that several large owners had supported Elliott’s call for a market check to identify meaningful interest to buy the company.In the absence of a real buyer, Elliott has said that management should consider buying back its own shares to boost the share price, now trading as much as 50% below what Elliott said was its potential level.For Elliott, the Portola deal was only the latest in a string of missteps that include the purchase of Achillion Pharmaceuticals for $930 million, as the company tries to diversify its revenue base away from its bestselling drugs for rare blood disorders. It also cited an unexpected and unexplained departure of Paul Clancy, a former chief financial officer, as worrying investors.Elliott’s letter took aim at the board, saying the group “is in urgent need of fresh perspectives and a new direction.” Directors Deborah Dunsire and Judith Reinsdorf were the most recent additions, joining the Alexion board in 2018.Investors could signal unhappiness with the company’s direction by withholding support for the chairman of Alexion’s board, David Brennan, said industry analyst Don Bilson at research firm Gordon Haskett."

2020-5-26,BREAKINGVIEWS-Sanofi finds M&A cure to CEO foot-in-mouth disease,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2D81RY,"(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.)LONDON, May 26 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson is not letting a small Covid-19 brouhaha put him off his stride. The French drugmaker is selling a $13 billion stake in U.S. biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals , giving it a pristine balance sheet to do deals and invest in new drugs. It’s a nice problem to have amid a global pandemic.The decision to sell a Regeneron stake isn’t linked to the coronavirus. Hudson first hinted at it back in December. But it shows he has quickly shrugged off the kerfuffle triggered when he honestly suggested the United States could have first dibs on a new Covid-19 vaccine, angering the French government. And his sense of timing is good: Regeneron’s stock has risen 85% over the last year.The sale will end one of big pharma’s more successful forays in biotech investing, although Sanofi will continue to hold a small stake. Regeneron’s share price has boomed over 2500% since 2007, when Sanofi increased its stake to 19%, which it later topped up further. Blockbusters to emerge include dermatitis treatment Dupixent, which Citigroup estimates could generate annual sales of $11 billion.Still, the exit makes sense. Sanofi’s stock has lingered in recent years, thanks to falling prices in diabetes drugs, and a lackluster pipeline. At the end of 2019, Hudson announced a plan to slim down, cut costs, and invest. Regeneron, worth $64 billion, is probably too big to acquire outright, leaving Sanofi with an awkward 20.6% stake in a company it can’t control. Instead, Hudson can channel the proceeds into new drugs, such as potential vaccines for the coronavirus, and companies.That means more risk for investors. Hudson has hinted that Sanofi could look at deals worth up to $5 billion. He could buy in hot areas such as oncology, or more niche sectors such as rare diseases and gene therapy. Yet, with cash from the sale, Sanofi’s net debt could disappear by 2021, according to Refinitiv data, adding to the pressure to make acquisitions. Sanofi’s track record is shaky: It recently wrote down the $12 billion purchase of Bioverativ, executed by Hudson’s predecessor.Sanofi’s stock is valued at just 13 times forward earnings, lagging a pharmaceutical average of around 15 times according to Refinitiv data, suggesting investors are still wary of the stock. Hudson at least now has plenty of firepower to execute his plan.On Twitter twitter.com/Unmack1- Sanofi said on May 25 it planned to sell most of its 20.6% stake in U.S. biotech group Regeneron Pharmaceuticals.- The French pharmaceutical firm will carry out a public offering of the stock, after which Regeneron will buy back a further $5 billion tranche.- Sanofi currently holds 23.2 million of Regeneron shares, worth approximately $13.2 billion. After the sale, it will continue to own 400,000 shares, and the two companies will continue to collaborate on developing new drugs.- For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on- SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS bit.ly/BVsubscribe"

Mai (Reuters) - Es folgt der Reuters-Blick zu wichtigen Entwicklungen in der Unternehmenswelt über die Top-Themen des Tages hinaus:NOVARTIS - Zürich: Der Schweizer Pharmakonzern wird den Wirkstoff seines neuen Augenmedikaments Beovu künftig in Österreich herstellen. Das Werk im tirolerischen Kundl wird für 30 Millionen Dollar ausgebaut und soll die Wirksubstanz ab kommenden Jahr dann exklusiv bereitstellen. Derzeit wird auch noch in der Schweiz produziert. Novartis traut Beovu, das gegen die Augenerkrankung AMD eingesetzt wird, Milliardenumsätze zu. Das Mittel muss allerdings gegen bereits gut etablierte Medikamente wie Eylea von Bayer und Regeneron und das von Novartis gemeinsam mit Roche vertriebene Lucentis bestehen.SIXT LEASING - Düsseldorf: Die Hyundai Capital Bank Europe hält nach Ablauf der zweiten Annahmefrist rund 92 Prozent an der bisherigen Leasing-Tochter des Autovermieters Sixt. Bei einer Mindestannahmeschwelle von 55 Prozent hatten die Aktionäre zum Ende der regulären Annahmefrist lediglich 72,84 Prozent zum Kauf angedient. “Wir sind optimistisch, dass die noch ausstehenden Angebotsbedingungen in den nächsten Monaten erfüllt werden, und erwarten den Abschluss der Transaktion in der zweiten Jahreshälfte 2020”, erklärte der Finanzvorstand von Sixt Leasing, Björn Waldow.AUSTRIAN AIRLINES - Wien: Österreich pocht im Gegenzug für Staatshilfen für die strauchelnde Lufthansa-Tochter Austrian Airlines (AUA) auf eine Absicherung des Langstrecken-Drehkreuz in Wien. Vom Management der Lufthansa erwarte man sich Vorschläge, “die hier auch die Situation betrachten, dass Wien genauso wichtig ist wie München oder Frankfurt”, sagte Wirtschaftsministerin Margarete Schramböck. Zudem müsse die AUA Flugzeuge haben, die diese Strecken auch abdecken können. “Die jetzigen Flieger sind in die Jahre gekommen”, sagte die Ministerin. Drängen lassen will sich die Regierung aber nicht. “Hier rasch zu handeln und Geschwindigkeit vor Qualität gehen zu lassen, das ist nicht unser Ziel”, sagte Schramböck.AXA - Paris: Der Versicherungskonzern will nach dem jüngsten Gerichtsurteil den Großteil der Ansprüche einiger Restaurantbesitzer begleichen. AXA teilte mit, weitere 500 Millionen Euro zur Kompensation von Ansprüchen kleinerer Unternehmen bereitstellen zu wollen. Vorstandschef Thomas Buberl kündigte an, AXA plane, die Verluste von Betriebsunterbrechungen wegen der Virus-Krise für die Mehrheit der Restaurantbesitzer auszugleichen, die dem vor Gericht verhandelten Fall ähnelten. “Diese Verträge machen weniger als zehn Prozent aller Verträge mit Restaurantbesitzern aus, und ich bin zuversichtlich, dass wir eine Lösung finden werden”, so Buberl. Im Streit um Betriebsschließungs-Versicherungen für Hotels und Gaststätten in der Corona-Krise hatte der französische Branchenriese vergangene Woche eine Niederlage einstecken müssen.DAIMLER - Frankfurt: Die Lkw-Tochter Daimler Truck und der Motorenhersteller Rolls-Royce Power Systems planen eine Kooperation zu Entwicklung und Vertrieb von stationären Notstromversorgungssystemen mit Brennstoffzellentechnik. Diese sollen emissionsfreie Alternativen zu Dieselmotoren bieten, die bislang als Notstromaggregate oder zur Abdeckung von Spitzenlasten eingesetzt werden. Bis Ende des Jahres soll ein erstes Demonstrationsgerät in Friedrichshafen in Betrieb gehen und der Kooperationsvertrag unterzeichnet werden. Daimler gründet mit dem Lkw-Hersteller Volvo ein Joint Venture, um den noch relativ teuren Brennstoffzellenantrieb auch bei Nutzfahrzeugen zum Einsatz zu bringen.SAMSUNG GROUP - Seoul: Der juristische Ärger für den Erben des südkoreanischen Firmenkonglomerats und Vize-Verwaltungsratschefs des Elektronikkonzerns Samsung Electronics, Jay Y. Lee, nimmt zu. Am Dienstag wurde der 51-Jährige, der 2018 bereits ein Jahr wegen Bestechung im Gefängnis saß, von der Staatsanwaltschaft wegen einer umstrittenen Fusion sowie mutmaßlichen Buchhaltungsbetrugs vernommen. Im Mittelpunkt der Ermittlungen stehen die Biotechfirma Samsung Biologics wie auch der Baukonzern Samsung C&T, dessen größter Aktionär Lee ist.

2020-5-26,Sanofi shares down despite $13 billion Regeneron payday,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2321LZ,"PARIS (Reuters) - Shares in Sanofi SASY.PA fell on Tuesday despite the French drugmaker's impending $13 billion payday from selling most of its 20.6% stake in U.S. partner Regeneron REGN.O.By 1111 GMT, shares in Sanofi were down 1%, in line with the broader European health index .SXDP.The stake sale, part of a major overhaul under new CEO Paul Hudson, will see Regeneron repurchase $5 billion of its stock with the rest set for a public offering. Sanofi will keep some 400,000 Regeneron shares -- a stake of less than 1%.Its existing collaborations with the company will continue.The partnership goes back to 2003 and helped Sanofi to return to profits with the development of several key medicines including eczema treatment Dupixent, which has become a star product for both companies.Based on Regeneron’s closing share price of $569.91 on Friday, the transaction translates into proceeds of around 12 billion euros ($13.15 billion).“We believe it is a good strategic decision to free up financial resources and to exit from a minority stake with no real strategic value,” said Bryan Garnier analyst Jean-Jacques Le Fur in a note.In recent months, Sanofi has simplified its structure and ended research efforts in diabetes and cardiovascular drugs to focus on more lucrative treatments in rare diseases and cancer.“The head of research and development John Reed has often said that he would like the group to be more involved in the gene therapy space for example,” said Le Fur.The companies’ rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara is being tested for treating Covid 19.Although it will discontinue accounting for its ownership in Regeneron and restate its 2019 earnings, Sanofi said it was still expecting earnings per share to grow by around 5% at constant exchange rates this year.The guidance from this new base however implies 2020 earnings per share of 5.83 euros, JPMorgan wrote in a note, 6% below its estimates."

2020-5-27,"Roche, Novartis highlight intensifying rivalry in eye disease, MS",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2330I0,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss drugmakers Roche and Novartis underscored how their portfolios are increasingly clashing on the commercial battlefield, announcing on Wednesday new data on drugs aimed at capturing market share from each other.Roche said its port delivery system (PDS) requiring twice-yearly refills of a customised version of eye drug Lucentis was as good as monthly injections against blindness-causing macular degeneration, a market Novartis is also targeting with its new medicine Beovu.Meanwhile, Novartis said ofatumumab, its older injectible leukaemia drug also known as Arzerra, showed promising results in halting relapsing multiple sclerosis, a clear shot at Roche’s nearly $4 billion-per-year blockbuster drug Ocrevus that works similarly but must be taken as an infusion.The companies stare each other down across the Rhine River in Basel and have clashed and cooperated over the years on various medicines. But these examples show more direct competition is inevitable, as Roche Chief Executive Severin Schwan branches out beyond cancer drugs to fresh treatment areas and Novartis boss Vas Narashiman augments his portfolio in identical disease territory.With its port -- a refillable, surgically inserted reservoir -- Roche seeks to offer a new option for patients wary of frequent, direct-in-the-eye injections. That mirrors Novartis’s selling point for Beovu, launched last year: potentially cutting down on unpleasant trips to the eye doctor required with either Lucentis or Bayer’s and Regeneron’s rival medicine Eylea.And with Novartis’s immune system-targeting ofatumumab, the company is playing the COVID-19 card: Drugs division head Marie-France Tschudin has said its once-monthly, at-home injections in the post-coronavirus era may appeal to MS patients seeking to avoid twice-yearly infusions at a clinic required for Roche’s Ocrevus that may take a couple of hours.Novartis sees ofatumumab’s U.S. approval in June. Roche said it hopes the port gets approval “as soon as possible”."

2020-5-27,BREAKINGVIEWS-Bankers\xe2\x80\x99 share sale boom hints at fragile recovery,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2D92KG,"(The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are her own.)LONDON, May 27 (Reuters Breakingviews) - Tuesday was a busy day for European equity capital market bankers. They rushed to place shares on behalf of clients like Saint Gobain, which offloaded $2.7 billion of stock in Swiss chemical group Sika through a so-called block trade. The return of these risky transactions, and surge in secondary share sales, send a warning over the durability of the recent stock market recovery.Block trades allow institutions, often a private equity firm or large company to quickly sell shares they own in another business. Banks compete to buy the shares directly at a discount to the secondary market price, and then place them with investors, usually leaving them exposed if shares can’t be sold at that price.The Sika deal, however, shows that block trades are not always straightforward. Citigroup priced the shares to investors at 168 Swiss francs, a discount of 5.5% on Tuesday’s close. Yet the bank did not tell investors that it had placed all the stock on Tuesday evening, and rival bankers speculate that it was left holding part of the block. On Wednesday morning, the shares fell as low as 166 Swiss francs, potentially meaning a loss for Citi, if it had been holding the shares. Since then, however, Sika’s stock price has bounced back to 169 Swiss francs.The pandemic aftermath should be a fertile one for this risky business. Companies may want to sell stakes to raise cash to pay down debt or fund acquisitions. And markets are buoyant, thanks to greater certainty over earnings. While some companies are still raising fresh capital, such as Infineon Technologies’ 1 billion euro capital increase on Tuesday, equity market business is shifting towards secondary share sales. Some 4 billion euros of such deals were completed in Europe on Tuesday alone. In the United States, French group Sanofi announced plans to sell $8 billion of Regeneron Pharmaceuticals stock.The flurry of activity suggests, however, that the stock market recovery may be short-lived. The rush to sell implies that companies agree with Deutsche Bank Chief Executive Christian Sewing, who said on Tuesday markets were too optimistic about a recovery. Thanks to a flood of central bank support, equity markets are brushing off high unemployment and contracting western economies. Depressing economic fundamentals may soon shut the block trade window.On Twitter twitter.com/dasha_reuters- French construction group Saint Gobain sold down $2.7 billion worth of shares in Swiss materials group Sika on May 26. The deal was underwritten by Citigroup. Sika shares temporarily fell below the offer price of 168 Swiss francs on May 27. At 0910 GMT, however, Sika stock was trading at 169 Swiss francs ($174).- On May 26, Germany’s RAG-Stiftung sold around $200 million of shares in Stadler Rail, cutting its stake to 5%. In morning trading on May 27, the stock was trading at almost 40 Swiss francs, above the offer price of 38 Swiss francs.- For previous columns by the author, Reuters customers can click on- SIGN UP FOR BREAKINGVIEWS EMAIL ALERTS bit.ly/BVsubscribe"

2020-5-29,Take Five: Hong Kong takes center stage,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN23526J,"LONDON (Reuters) - 1/ TESTY RELATIONSChina just concluded its closed-door annual meeting of parliament, the National People’s Congress (NPC), with top officials making clear that employment is the top priority.Fiscal stimulus worth more than 4% of GDP has been commissioned, primarily to boost jobs and incomes, but not at the expense of financial stability. Markets might want to keep one eye on the employment indicators coming out of manufacturing surveys due in coming days. Money markets are tight, the yuan is weakening. Markets are heading into June wondering if China will cut bank reserves or let the currency slip further.But the elephant in the room is the standoff between Washington and China over Beijing’s new security legislation for Hong Kong, which many lawyers, diplomats and investors fear could erode the city’s freedoms.The weekend is packed with action: Hong Kong braces for more street protests, the U.S. administration reviews the city’s special status and President Donald Trump preps a response. Whether he goes so far as to scupper his 2019 Phase 1 trade deal with China or merely takes some symbolic steps around sanctions and visas for Hong Kong citizens could determine how long the latest global stock market rally will last.(GRAPHIC: Hong Kong trade with US, China - )The growing divergence between an increasingly dire economic landscape and a roaring U.S. stock market will be on display on Friday when May non-farm payroll employment data is reported.The rise in weekly jobless claims since the April survey week points to another grim payroll figure for May. A Reuters poll showed economists expect U.S. employers to have cut 7.45 million jobs in May, compared with the record 20.5 million jobs lost in April.While some encouraging signs in the employment picture have emerged in recent weeks as some workers rejoin jobs with businesses starting to reopen, these changes are unlikely to be reflected in the May data.Any positive surprise, however, is likely to be cheered by stock market bulls eager to grasp at signs of a rebound from the coronavirus induced economic slump.(GRAPHIC: Taking stock of payrolls data - )On the surface, the 750 billion euro European Union plan to prop up economies hammered by the coronavirus pandemic eases pressure on the European Central Bank which has long urged Europe’s leaders to do more to strengthen the bloc’s economy.So, ECB rate setters meeting on Thursday could well hold back until the EU deal is done, right? Well no, argue many economists, who believe fresh stimulus in June is more likely than not. After all, the EU recovery fund will take time to set up and will likely face hurdles on the way, they say.In addition, the ECB is burning through its emergency asset purchases, which will likely run dry by October - unless expanded. And the unprecedented nature of the COVID-19 shock means the economic outlook remains far from certain.Fresh ECB stimulus would likely fuel gains in southern European bonds and the euro, basking at two-month highs on the recovery fund optimism. If further ECB stimulus is matter of when not if, the key question for the ECB is, why wait?(GRAPHIC: The ECB's QE programme - )May has been remarkable for big ticket capital raises by companies, institutional investors and shareowners with several billion dollars being raised to tackle the fallout from the virus-hit, bringing life back into equity capital markets.In Europe, a bumper virtual coffee IPO of coffee maker JDE Peet's JDEP.AS is the icing on the cake. Hard hit by coronavirus lockdowns, companies raised money in equity and bond markets to help them weather the crisis and smoothly restart their businesses as restrictions ease. Rolls-Royce, Whitbread and Infineon were big names in Europe. In the United States, PNC Financial Services’ selldown of its BlackRock stake and Sanofi exiting Regeneron sparked a flood of deals.The rush for cash also put the spotlight back on convertibles - selling bonds that can convert into stocks. Commerzbank said it may sell 3-billion-euro worth contingent convertible bond.That search of money has been more visible in the U.S. than Europe, though the levels of issuance has been well-below levels seen in the wale of the 2008 financial crisis. Meanwhile rising equity supply and falling buybacks may restrain the stock market rally, some analysts say.(GRAPHIC: Bounce bank in markets - )Britain heads into another round of Brexit talks ahead of the June 18-19 European Union summit by which time London needs to make up its mind about asking for an extension to the transition agreement.British officials have repeatedly said they won’t do so, but the clock is ticking and there’s not much time left until the end of December when Britain and the EU part ways - with or without a trade deal.Negotiators have not made much progress. Britain says an agreement on fisheries might not be ready by July and it is down to Brussels to break a fundamental impasse. The EU urges Britain to make a bigger effort and be more realistic about what it can achieve in these talks.All this toing and froing keeps the pound close to its lowest in nearly three decades. And as if a potentially messy Brexit was not enough, the British currency is also grappling with the prospect of negative interest rates, a deep recession and a growing pile of debt.(GRAPHIC: Sterling still not far from March lows - )"

Within one to three days the majority of these patients got better in terms of ventilation and oxygen needs,” Astra’s Baselga told Reuters.Severe cases of COVID-19 are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune system known as cytokine storm and initial research has brought Calquence, and other drugs that suppress certain elements of the immune system, into play.Autoimmune disease drugs that are being tested for their ability to quell the cytokine storm include Regeneron and Sanofi’s Kevzara, Roche’s Actemra as well as Morphosys and GlaxoSmithKline’s otilimab.In its approved use, Calquence competes with AbbVie and Johnson & Johnson’s established treatment Imbruvica as a treatment for chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, a common type of adult leukaemia."

2020-6-09,Explainer: What are antibody therapies and who is developing them for COVID-19?,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN23G0QN,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - While some potential vaccines have emerged in the global race to find a way to stop the spread of COVID-19, many scientists and researchers believe antibody based therapies hold great promise for treating people already infected with the disease.These therapies use antibodies generated by infected humans or animals to fight off the disease in patients. They date back to the late 19th century, when researchers used a serum derived from the blood of infected animals to treat diphtheria.For COVID-19 treatment, researchers are studying the use of convalescent plasma and other treatments made with blood from recently recovered patients.More recently, scientists have developed treatments called monoclonal antibodies -- antibodies that can be isolated and manufactured in large quantities to treat diseases like Ebola or cancer. Companies, like Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O in the United States, are trying to use this approach to develop their treatments.Unlike convalescent plasma, manufacturers do not need a steady supply of antibody-rich blood to produce monoclonal antibodies, so this approach could be easier to scale up.In general, the goal of a vaccine is to generate an immune response that can prevent someone from getting ill with a disease, whereas antibody-derived products are generally designed to treat disease.And while some drugmakers have suggested antibody treatments can be used prophylactically - Regeneron’s Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos has said their treatment could be a bridge to a vaccine - it could be expensive.“You might go into nursing homes or the military and use it because antibodies have a pretty long half life,” said Dr. Betty Diamond, Director of Molecular Medicine at the Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research.“You might decide that you are going to use this as a prevention in this very high risk group, but you wouldn’t do that for the whole country.”The amount of protein in antibody drugs makes the treatment more expensive than vaccines in general, Feng Hui, chief operating officer at Shanghai Junshi Biosciences 1877.HK, said.Designing antibody drugs to treat or protect high risk people, including those with weak immune systems, could require hundreds, or even over a thousand times more protein than found in a vaccine shot, according to Junshi.Eli Lilly is collaborating with Junshi and Canadian biotech firm AbCellera Biologics to develop different antibody treatments, both of which have started early stage testing in humans.Regeneron plans to start clinical studies later this month to test its antibody cocktail treatment, which was derived from antibodies from genetically-modified mice. It aims to have hundreds of thousands of preventative doses available “by the end of the summer or the fall.”The CoVIg-19 Plasma Alliance, which includes Japan's Takeda Pharmaceuticals 4502.T and CSL Behring, is working on hyperimmune globulin therapy derived from convalescent plasma, which could offer a standardized dose of antibodies and doesn't need to be limited to patients with matching blood types.The Antibody Therapy Against Coronavirus (ATAC) project, funded by the European Commission and led by Sweden’s Karolinska research institute, is looking at a similar approach as well as monoclonal antibodies.

2020-6-10,Abbvie to partner with Denmark\'s Genmab in $750 mln cancer therapy deal,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2DN2HW,"(Reuters) - Abbvie Inc ABBV.N said on Wednesday it is partnering with Danish biotech firm Genmab AS GMAB.CO to jointly develop and market cancer treatments, as it looks to expand its cancer franchise.The U.S.-based pharma giant will pay Genmab $750 million up front to jointly develop and commercialize three of Genmab’s cancer-targeting antibody products, including its potential blood cancer treatment, epcoritamab, currently in a mid-stage study.Genmab could receive up to $3.15 billion in additional development, regulatory and sales milestone payments.The deal, which covers three of Genmab’s so-called bispecific antibodies, validates a new technology that uses complex therapeutic proteins that can latch onto the body’s immune cells and connect them with cancer cells.Genmab's rivals in the race to develop bispecific antibodies include Roche ROG.S, GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L and Bristol-Myers Squibb BMY.N.The deal provides Genmab with cash to not only advance its clinical development candidates, but also to start building its commercial infrastructure, said RBC analyst Kennen MacKayAbbVie, which makes blockbuster blood cancer drug Imbruvica, is testing treatments for more than 20 different types of cancer, and has faced some research setbacks recently.In August, the company abandoned experimental treatment Rova-T after the drug flunked a lung cancer trial, writing off most of the $5.8 billion it paid the drug’s developer, Stemcentrx, in 2016.The Genmab deal tops expectations and gives the Illinois-based drugmaker access to several experimental antibodies to strengthen its cancer portfolio, as well as allows Genmab to fend off fierce competition from Roche Holding AG ROG.S and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O in Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said Citi analyst Peter Verdult.Abbvie plans to combine antibodies being developed by both companies with its antibody drug conjugates, described by researchers as “guided missiles”.“By combining the strengths of our two organizations, we can advance the treatment landscape for patients battling cancer,” Michael Severino, AbbVie’s vice chairman, said in a statement.Genmab shares rose as much as 4.8% in Copenhagen trading after the announcement."
2020-6-10,Anti-inflammatory and cancer drugs tested in UK as possible COVID-19 therapy,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN23H1C9,"LONDON (Reuters) - Two drugs used to treat inflammatory diseases and cancer are being tested as potential therapies for patients with COVID-19, the Universities of Birmingham and Oxford announced on Wednesday.Severe cases of COVID-19 are believed to be triggered by an over-reaction of the immune system, known as a cytokine storm, and researchers are investigating whether drugs that suppress certain elements of the immune system can play a role in arresting a rapid escalation of symptoms.Izana Bioscience’s Namilumab, a monoclonal antibody already in late-stage tests to treat rheumatoid arthritis and an inflammatory disease called ankylosing spondylitis, is the first of four candidates in the CATALYST trial.It targets a cytokine called GM-CSF, which in uncontrolled levels is believed to be a key driver of the excessive and dangerous lung inflammation seen in COVID-19 patients.The drug is already being tested as a COVID-19 therapy in Italy.The second drug, Infliximab (CT-P13), developed by Slough-based Celltrion Healthcare UK, is an anti-tumour necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. It is used to treat eight autoimmune diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and irritable bowel syndrome.Ben Fisher, trial co-clinical investigator from the University of Birmingham, said: “Emerging evidence is demonstrating a critical role for anti-inflammatory drugs in the cytokine storm associated with severe COVID-19 infection.“In the CATALYST study we hope to show with a single dose of these kinds of drugs in hospitalised patients that we are able to delay or prevent the rapid deterioration into intensive care and requirement for invasive ventilation in this critical patient group.”Other autoimmune disease drugs that are being tested for their ability to quell the cytokine storm in trials include Regeneron and Sanofi’s Kevzara, Roche’s Actemra as well as Morphosys and GlaxoSmithKline’s otilimab.Japan’s Takeda has a strategic equity stake in Izana."

2020-6-11,Regeneron begins human testing of COVID-19 antibody cocktail,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN23I1OP,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Thursday said it has begun human testing of its experimental antibody cocktail as a treatment for COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The trial has an “adaptive” design and could quickly move from dozens of patients to eventually include thousands, Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos told Reuters.“If it goes perfectly well, within a week or two we will move to the second phase. Within a month or so of that we will have clear data that this is or isn’t working. By the end of summer, we could have sufficient data for broad utilization.”Regeneron shares rose about 2% in early trading.The dual antibody, called REGN-COV2, is being compared with a placebo treatment in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, and in COVID-19 patients who have symptoms but are not sick enough to be hospitalized. Regeneron also plans to study REGN-COV2 for preventing the infection in people at high-risk of exposure - such as healthcare workers - and in uninfected people with close exposure to someone who has tested positive for the virus.Antibodies are proteins made by the body’s immune system that recognize, bind and neutralize an invading virus. Regeneron’s cocktail - which contains an antibody made by the company and a second isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19 - is designed so that its two antibodies bind to the coronavirus’ spike protein, limiting the ability of viruses to escape.Trial patients will be given a single intravenous infusion of REGN-COV2. In the prevention segments of the study, participants will be given smaller subcutaneous doses, Yancopoulus said. Investigators will be measuring patients’ viral loads and keeping track of symptoms.Regeneron said its treatment could be useful even if a COVID-19 vaccine is developed since the elderly and people with compromised immune systems often do not respond well to vaccines.Yancopoulos said, even though Regeneron does not yet have proof that REGN-COV2 is effective, the company has cleared the way for production of the antibody compound at its New York manufacturing facility.Eli Lilly and Co could have a drug specifically designed to treat COVID-19 authorized for use as early as September if all goes well with either of two antibody therapies it is testing, its chief scientist told Reuters on Wednesday."

2020-6-18,Roche rheumatoid arthritis drug fails to help COVID-19 patients in Italian study,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2DU2HV,"(Reuters) - Roche’s rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra failed to help patients with early-stage COVID-19 pneumonia in an Italian study, the latest instance in which an anti-inflammatory drug has fallen through in a coronavirus trial.Despite the setback, the Swiss drugmaker said that it is pressing ahead with testing Actemra in another trial against COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.Actemra did not reduce severe respiratory symptoms, intensive care visits, or death any better than standard treatments, the Italian Medicines Agency (Aifa), Italy’s drugs regulator which authorized the study, said in a statement on Wednesday.The trial, which enrolled 126 patients, about a third of the intended number, was stopped early after an interim analysis raised doubts about the anti-inflammatory medicine’s effectiveness.“Although not effective in all patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, it is possible that selected subgroups of patients may have a better response,” Aifa said.Sales of Actemra jumped 30% in the first quarter, Roche said in April, on hopes it would help in the fight against the new coronavirus.Its failure to do so in the Italian study now adds to questions about the role of drugs like Actemra, which are designed to inhibit interleukin-6 (IL-6) proteins associated with dangerous inflammation, in treating COVID-19.A similar IL-6 inhibitor, Sanofi and Regeneron’s arthritis drug Kevzara, failed in a trial in April to help a group comprised of severely ill and critically ill patients, leading the drugmakers to continue to test high doses of Kevzara only in those considered critically ill with COVID-19.Detailed data from the Italian Actemra study, which involved 24 medical centres, will be sent to a scientific journal.Meanwhile, Roche has completed enrolment of its own Actemra study in patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 pneumonia. That “will provide robust evidence about the benefit/ risk profile”, a Roche spokesman said, with data expected in the next few months.Last month Roche also announced plans to study whether combining Actemra with Gilead Sciences Inc’s antiviral treatment remdesivir works better against severe COVID-19 pneumonia than remdesivir alone.Remdesivir has shortened hospital stays of COVID-19 patients."

2020-6-24,U.S. claims Regeneron paid kickbacks via charity to boost expensive drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN23V2JY,"BOSTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sued Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, accusing it of using a charity that helps cover Medicare patients’ drug costs as a means to pay kickbacks for using its expensive macular degeneration drug Eylea.The government filed a lawsuit against the company in federal court in Boston, the latest case to result from an industry-wide probe of drugmakers’ financial support of patient assistance charities.Drug companies are prohibited from subsidizing co-payments for patients enrolled in the government healthcare program for those aged 65 and older. Companies may donate to non-profits providing co-pay assistance as long as they are independent.But the lawsuit said Tarrytown, New York-based Regeneron following the launch of Eylea in 2011 began funneling tens of millions of dollars through a patient assistance foundation to ensure virtually no one on Medicare had to pay co-pays.The lawsuit said the scheme helped Regeneron boost sales for the drug, which typically costs over $10,000 per year. From 2013 to 2014, when the scheme was operating, Medicare paid $1.9 billion for Eylea, the lawsuit said.Regeneron in a statement said it would vigorously defend itself. “We do not believe there is any merit to the complaint,” the company said.Its stock price midday Wednesday was $604.62, down 3.84%.The lawsuit follows an investigation that has resulted in more than $865 million in settlements with drugmakers and charities, including the foundation the government says Regeneron used, Good Days, previously known as the Chronic Disease Fund.Good Days in October agreed to pay $2 million to resolve allegations it conspired with five other companies including Novartis AG to enable them to pay kickbacks to Medicare patients using their drugs. It did not admit wrongdoing.The case is U.S. v. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, U.S. District Court, District of Massachusetts, No. 20-11217."

Those who required oxygen without mechanical or high-flow oxygenation were considered severely ill.More than three dozen U.S. states were seeing a rise in COVID-19 cases, according to a Reuters analysis on Thursday, the latest grim sign that the coronavirus pandemic, once thought to be waning, was again spreading rapidly.Worldwide, the virus has infected 10.76 million people, resulting in 516,600 deaths.Shares of Regeneron were down $17.20 at $605.25 after hours.

2020-7-07,U.S. government awards Novavax $1.6 billion for coronavirus vaccine,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN248182,"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The U.S. government has awarded Novavax Inc $1.6 billion to cover testing and manufacturing of a potential vaccine for the novel coronavirus in the United States, with the aim of delivering 100 million doses by January.The award announced by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is the biggest yet from “Operation Warp Speed,” the White House initiative aimed at accelerating access to vaccines and treatments to fight COVID-19, the respiratory disease caused by the coronavirus.Shares in Gaithersburg, Maryland-based Novavax rose 29% to $102 in morning trading.“What this Warp Speed award does is it pays for production of 100 million doses, which would be delivered starting in the fourth quarter of this year, and may be completed by January or February of next year,” Novavax Chief Executive Stanley Erck told Reuters.It will also cover the cost of running a large Phase III trial, the final stage of human testing.Erck said Novavax expects results of its Phase I trial testing the vaccine’s safety within the next week or so. The company aims to start midstage trials in August or September, with Phase III testing starting in October, Erck added.The HHS announcement follows a $456 million investment in Johnson & Johnson’s vaccine candidate in March, a $486 million award to Moderna Inc in April, and up to $1.2 billion in support in May for AstraZeneca PLC’s vaccine being developed with Oxford University. The U.S. government also awarded Emergent Biosolutions Inc $628 million to expand domestic manufacturing capacity for a potential coronavirus vaccine and drugs to treat COVID-19.The addition of Novavax’s candidate to Operation Warp Speed’s portfolio “increases the odds that we will have at least one safe, effective vaccine as soon as the end of this year,” HHS Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement.Besides the massive cash infusion for Novavax, the U.S. government inked a $450 million contract with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc to make and supply its antibody cocktail for COVID-19.Novavax is somewhat of a dark horse in the race for a coronavirus vaccine. The company was not on the list of vaccine finalists for Warp Speed previously reported by the New York Times that included Moderna, AstraZeneca, Pfizer Inc, J&J and Merck & Co.In May, Novavax received an additional $388 million in funding for COVID-19 vaccine development from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), a private foundation, after a $4 million investment in March. In June, the U.S. Defense Department awarded the company $60 million to support manufacturing of 10 million doses of its vaccine in 2020.‘A BIG SCALE UP’The company is in the process of transferring its vaccine technology to an unnamed contract manufacturer that has two large manufacturing facilities, its CEO said. That is in addition to the work being done by Emergent Biosolutions, which is making doses to supply the company’s smaller early and midstage clinical trials.By early next year, Novavax expects to be able to make 50 million doses a month in the United States.“It’s a big scale up in a few different manufacturing sites in the United States,” Erck said. “What it leaves us with is the capacity of making many more doses in the U.S. in 2021.”Novavax did not start human safety trials until late May. One reason for the delay is that the vaccine is grown in insect cells, a process that can take 30 days before company scientists can start purifying it and making it in bulk.“You lose a month or so there, but I don’t think we’re behind because of our data,” Erck said, referring to animal data showing a strong immune response and high levels of virus-killing antibodies.Besides Moderna, the company trails two other candidates - one from AstraZeneca and Oxford University and one from Pfizer and BioNTech.Jefferies analyst Jared Holz said the cash infusion “places Novavax in a very enviable position should its data look compelling later in the year.”Although Novavax has not yet produced a licensed vaccine, Sanofi SA uses the same basic technology to make flu vaccine, “so the risk of us not succeeding is pretty low,” Dr. Gregory Glenn, president of research and development for Novavax, said in a telephone interview.The Novavax vaccine works in conjunction with an adjuvant - a substance that boosts the immune response to help the body build a robust defense against the virus.Currently, Novavax makes its adjuvant in Sweden. The company is building up U.S. manufacturing capacity for its adjuvant “so that we can make upwards of a billion doses of adjuvant in the United States,” Erck said.Novavax also has a manufacturing plant in the Czech Republic and hopes to have two other plants in Europe and one in Asia, Erck said. The company is also working with a manufacturer in India. The aim there is to make more than 100 million doses a month, Erck said."
2020-7-07,U.S. signs $450 mln contract with Regeneron for COVID-19 therapy,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2EE2LJ,"(Reuters) - The U.S. government signed a $450 million contract with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O for its potential COVID-19 antibody cocktail, the drugmaker said on Tuesday.The agreement, the first by the Trump administration to support a therapy, comes under the government’s “Operation Warp Speed” program that is aimed at faster distribution of vaccines and treatments to fight the new coronavirus when trials are successful.The United States is also funding manufacturing and several trials for potential vaccines and has rushed to secure billions of doses of the vaccines being tested by companies around the world.Earlier in the day, Novavax Inc NVAX.O received a $1.6 billion grant, the biggest award yet from Operation Warp Speed, to cover testing, manufacturing and sale of a potential coronavirus vaccine.Under the contract with Regeneron, signed with the HHS’ Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority and the Department of Defense, the doses manufactured under the project will be owned by the federal government.Regeneron's cocktail, REGN-COV2, contains an antibody made by the company and another isolated from recovered COVID-19 patients. Rivals Eli Lilly LLY.N and AbbVie ABBV.N are also pursuing antibody therapies for the respiratory illness. REGN-COV2 is being tested separately for both preventing and treating COVID-19, with a late-stage prevention trial being run jointly with the National Institutes of Health.The agreement covers a fixed number of bulk lots intended to be completed in the fall of 2020, Regeneron said.A range of 70,000 to 300,000 potential treatment doses or 420,000 to 1,300,000 prevention doses are expected to be available from these lots, with initial doses to be ready as early as end of summer.The U.S. government would make the doses available to Americans at no cost, if EUA or product approval is granted, Regeneron said.Shares of Regeneron were up 1.4% at $636.11. They have risen 67% so far this year."

2020-7-23,U.S. clears way for drugmakers to share COVID antibody capacity,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN24O30E,"(Reuters) - The U.S. Department of Justice on Thursday said it will not stand in the way of efforts by companies, including Eli Lilly and Co and Amgen Inc, to share information to help scale up capacity to manufacture antibody treatments for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus.In a letter to Lilly, Amgen, AbCellera Biologics, AstraZeneca Plc, Roche Holding’s Genentech unit and GlaxoSmithKline Plc, the DOJ said demand for monoclonal antibodies targeting COVID-19 is likely to exceed what one firm could produce on its own.The drugmakers are in various stages of developing experimental monoclonal antibodies - manufactured proteins designed to bind to a targeted cell, neutralize it and mark it for destruction by the immune system - for treatment, or even prevention, of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies are among the most common type of biotech medicines, used for cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and many other conditions.The DOJ did not include Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc, which expects to have definitive trial results for its dual-antibody treatment by late summer or early fall. The Department of Health and Human Services in June awarded Regeneron a $450 million contract and the company has cleared the way for U.S. manufacturing of its antibody cocktail by moving production of its other products to a plant in Ireland.“Waiting until regulators approve specific treatments before scaling up manufacturing might delay access to these potentially life-saving medicines by many months,” the agency said in its letter.The DOJ said the companies have committed not to exchange information related to the prices of any monoclonal antibodies that are eventually shown to be safe and effective and approved for use."
2020-7-24,U.S. drugmaker stocks fall ahead of Trump\'s pricing executive orders,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL3N2EV2Z7,"(Reuters) - Shares of U.S. drugmakers fell on Friday, ahead of executive orders by President Donald Trump aimed at lowering drug prices.With a re-election race underway and the coronavirus pandemic raging in the country, the White House is looking to bring down drug prices by reportedly considering tying them to what consumers outside the United States pay.The S&P 500 was down 1.3%, with drugmakers such as Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Pfizer inc weighing on the index. The declines were in line with a fall in broader markets.Given that the speculation of an executive order on drug pricing surfaced roughly a month ago, stocks in the healthcare sector are unlikely to take a hit in the near term, Jefferies analyst Jared Holz said.The administration’s move would likely be viewed more as political posturing than a critical moment for the pharmaceutical industry, Holz added.Trump, who had previously urged lawmakers to rein in drug costs, will deliver remarks and sign the executive orders at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Friday, according to the president’s schedule issued by the White House on Thursday.Drugmakers often negotiate rebates or discounts on their list prices in exchange for favorable treatment from insurers and other healthcare payers. As a result, insurers and covered patients rarely pay the full list price of a drug.Elimination of rebates is likely not included in the orders, Politico reported on Thursday. (politi.co/3huHoV0)Such an order would be positive for health insurers UnitedHealth Group Inc, Cigna Corp and CVS Health, said Mizuho analyst Ann Hynes.Cigna and CVS were among the handful of healthcare movers in the black.Drugmakers Johnson & Johnson and Merck & Co Inc were trading down in morning trading."

2020-8-03,Regeneron says antibody cocktail prevents and treats COVID-19 in animals,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2F520D,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Monday that the COVID-19 antibody drug combination it is developing both prevented and treated the disease in rhesus macaques and hamsters, adding to hope that it might work for people.The U.S. biotech company said in the animal study, which has not yet been peer reviewed, that the cocktail of two monoclonal antibodies was able to “almost completely block establishment of virus infection.”Regeneron said the cocktail was also able to minimize infection in a second study in which animals were infected with a much higher level of the virus. The prophylactic effect was greatly diminished with a lower dose of the drug, the company said.It said the results matched or exceeded effects recently shown in animal studies of vaccine candidates.Effective treatments and vaccines are seen as essential to halting a pandemic that has claimed more than 690,000 lives worldwide.The infected animals treated with the antibodies cleared the virus faster than those given a placebo, the company said.The lead researchers said the data suggests the therapy may offer clinical benefit in both prevention and treatment of COVID-19. They also said the animals did not show any signs of increased viral load or worsening of pathology after treatment, an important safety signal that suggests it will not worsen symptoms in humans.The studies were conducted on a total of 36 rhesus macaques and 50 hamsters. Positive results in animals are no guarantee of success in humans.Regeneron has already started late-stage clinical trials in humans to assess the antibody treatment’s ability to prevent and treat COVID-19.The company signed a $450 million contract with the U.S. government as part of its Operation Warp Speed program to provide the United States with the treatment if it succeeds.Monoclonal antibodies are among the most widely used biotechnology medicines.

The company hopes to have over 100,000 doses available by year-end, he said.“If it works, that’s not enough. Doses will have to be prioritized to patients that need it the most,” Skovronsky said in an interview, noting that preventing spread in nursing homes is one scenario that would likely be prioritized.The elderly are at particularly high risk for the disease that has claimed more than 690,000 lives globally.If the drug proves effective, Skovronsky said Lilly hopes to manufacture around a million doses by the end of 2021.The nursing homes trial is being conducted in partnership with several long-term care networks across the country, as well as the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.To speed the study, the company has created mobile research units including retrofitted recreational vehicles that can be deployed in response to coronavirus outbreaks at nursing homes across the United States.LY-CoV555 belongs to a class of drugs known as monoclonal antibodies, which are among the most widely used biotechnology medicines. Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O and other drugmakers are testing similar treatments against COVID-19.Last week, Lilly told investors that LY-CoV555 had moved into mid-stage trials as a treatment and that late-stage trials would begin in the coming weeks.Skovronsky said that the earliest data to be released would likely come from a Phase II study in patients with COVID-19 who have not been hospitalized.Because that study is based on measuring patients’ viral load - the amount of virus detectable in the blood - rather than preventing hospitalizations or deaths, the data could be released a few weeks after enrollment for the trial closes, he said.That data, however, might not be enough for the company to receive U.S. emergency use authorization for the drug, Skovronsky said, noting that the company may still have to show it can reduce hospitalizations or other risks to assure regulators.Eli Lilly shares were up around 1.6%."
2020-8-03,Rival drugmakers launch joint trial of medicines for COVID-19,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2EZ1CE,"(Reuters) - Rival drugmakers AbbVie Inc ABBV.N, Amgen Inc AMGN.O and Takeda Pharmaceuticals Inc 4502.T on Monday said they have begun treating patients in a trial to quickly show whether a drug from each company can be repurposed and used against COVID-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.The COVID-19 pandemic is an “all hands on deck moment,” David Reese, Amgen’s research and development chief told Reuters. “We wanted a trial to be able to quickly sift through multiple agents and prioritize.”The study is a collaboration among pharmaceutical industry members of the recently-formed COVID Research & Development Alliance, Quantum Leap Healthcare Collaborative, a partnership of medical researchers and investors, and the Food and Drug Administration.The first segment will test whether Amgen’s psoriasis drug Otezla, Takeda’s anti-inflammatory Firazyr and AbbVie’s cenicriviroc, which has been tried in patients with HIV, will help with the overactive, and potentially damaging, immune response that sometimes happens in patients with severe COVID-19.The study’s “adaptive platform” means several treatment candidates can be tested at the same time, with the most promising moving forward and the least promising dropping out, Quantum Leap co-founder Dr. Laura Esserman told Reuters.“We could have some results in as early as six weeks,” she said, adding that additional drugs will soon be added to the roster.Company officials said Otezla may be able to suppress inflammation from an overactive immune response; Firazyr may help limit fluid in the lungs; and cenicriviroc, which blocks activity of certain immune system cells, could reduce the severity of acute respiratory distress caused by the virus.The drugs are being dosed in combination with Gilead Sciences Inc's GILD.O antiviral drug remdesivir and generic steroid dexamethasone, both of which have been shown in rigorous trials to help COVID-19 patients and are now considered to be standard care, Dr. Esserman said. A comparison group of patients will be given remdesivir and dexamethasone alone.Hospitals have tried other anti-inflammatory drugs in COVID-19 patients, including Regeneron's REGN.O Kevzara and Roche Holding's ROG.S Actemra, but trials of both arthritis drugs failed to show effectiveness. Roche is continuing to test Actemra in combination with remdesivir.The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases' ongoing adaptive COVID-19 trial is studying remdesivir in combination with Olumiant, an arthritis drug sold by Eli Lilly & Co LLY.N. Those results are expected next month.Since the outbreak began seven months ago, so far killing more than 675,000 people worldwide, hundreds of clinical trials have been launched around the world to test whether existing drugs or experimental compounds could be effective treatments.“There are a huge number of trials that for all the best intentions have been stood up around the world, but many are smaller - what we would call underpowered - and will not provide definitive answers,” Amgen’s Reese said."
2020-8-04,Next big COVID-19 treatment may be manufactured antibodies,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN24Z1DY,"(Reuters) - As the world awaits a COVID-19 vaccine, the next big advance in battling the pandemic could come from a class of biotech therapies widely used against cancer and other disorders - antibodies designed specifically to attack this new virus.Development of monoclonal antibodies to target the virus has been endorsed by leading scientists. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious diseases expert, called them “almost a sure bet” against COVID-19.When a virus gets past the body’s initial defenses, a more specific response kicks in, triggering production of cells that target the invader. These include antibodies that recognize and lock onto a virus, preventing the infection from spreading.Monoclonal antibodies - grown in bioreactor vats - are copies of these naturally-occurring proteins.Scientists are still working out the exact role of neutralizing antibodies in recovery from COVID-19, but drugmakers are confident that the right antibodies or a combination can alter the course of the disease that has claimed more than 675,000 lives globally.""Antibodies can block infectivity. That is a fact,"" Regeneron Pharmaceuticals REGN.O executive Christos Kyratsous told Reuters. Regeneron is testing a two-antibody cocktail, which it believes limits the ability of the virus’ to escape better than one, with data on its efficacy expected by late summer or early fall. “Protection will wane over time. Dosing is something we don’t know yet,” said Kyratsous.The U.S. government in June awarded Regeneron a $450 million supply contract. The company said it can immediately begin production at its U.S. plant if regulators approve the treatment.Eli Lilly and Co <LLY.N, AstraZeneca AZN.L, Amgen AMGN.O, and GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L were cleared by the U.S. government to pool manufacturing resources in order to scale up supplies if any of these drugs prove successful.Even with that unusual cooperation among rivals, manufacturing these medicines is complex and capacity is limited. There is also a debate over whether a single antibody will be powerful enough to stop COVID-19.AstraZeneca said it plans to start human trials of its dual-antibody combination within weeks.Lilly, which began human testing in June of two antibody candidates in separate trials, is focusing on a one-drug approach.“If you need a higher dosage or more antibodies, fewer people can be treated,” Lilly Chief Scientific Officer Dan Skovronsky said.‘INSTANT IMMUNITY’Unlike vaccines, which activate the body’s own immune system, the impact of infused antibodies eventually dissipates.Still, drugmakers say monoclonal antibodies could temporarily prevent infection in at-risk people such as medical workers and the elderly. They could also be used as a therapeutic bridge until vaccines become widely available.""In a prophylactic setting we think we may achieve coverage for up to six months,"" said Phil Pang, chief medical officer of Vir Biotechnology VIR.O, which aims to start testing an antibody in non-hospitalized patients next month with partner GSK.""The advantage of an antibody is that it is basically instant immunity,"" said Mark Brunswick, senior vice president at Sorrento Therapeutics SRNE.O, which aims to begin human trials next month of a single antibody candidate. Safety risks for monoclonal antibodies are considered low, but their cost can be quite high. These type of drugs for cancer can cost over $100,000 a year.There is also concern that the coronavirus could become resistant to specific antibodies. Researchers are already at work on second-generation compounds with targets other than the crown-like spikes the virus uses to invade cells.""We are trying to develop something that is complementary,"" Amgen research chief David Reese said. Amgen is working with Adaptive Biotechnologies Corp ADPT.O.Researchers in a recent paper published in the journal Nature said they had discovered several new, very potent, antibodies directed to an area where the virus attaches to human cells and to a region of the spike that has not attracted attention.“To avoid development of resistance you want to target different sites,” study author and Columbia University professor David Ho told Reuters.There are also questions about when in the course of the illness it might be best to employ these new weapons.“Giving an antibody later on after infection might not be that helpful, said Florian Krammer, microbiology professor at New York’s Icahn School of Medicine. “Given early, they probably work well.”"

2020-8-17,Breakingviews - Sanofi begins M&A spree with low-risk $3.7 bln bet,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN25D1GF,"LONDON (Reuters Breakingviews) - Sanofi Chief Executive Paul Hudson is starting a potential M&A spree in a relatively safe fashion. The French drugmaker is buying American biotech Principia Biopharma for $3.7 billion, boosting its presence in the lucrative field of diseases in which the immune system attacks the body. Buying an established collaborator reduces risk, while allowing Sanofi to save on royalty payments.Sanofi has plenty of cash to splash around. In May, the $127 billion pharmaceuticals group sold a $12 billion stake in U.S. biotech Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, which Hudson plans to plough back into drug development and acquisitions to replenish his pipeline and make up for stagnant diabetes drug sales. Jefferies analysts reckon the group has up to $25 billion of firepower, after factoring in its relatively low debt.Sanofi’s close acquaintance with its target removes some of the risks. Principia’s main drugs, so-called Bruton tyrosine kinase inhibitors, seek to stop the immune system from causing inflammation or tissue destruction. The French group already owns the licensing rights to Principia’s key multiple sclerosis drugs, which should give it a clearer view on its prospects. Buying the whole company will give it wiggle room to use the drug with fewer restrictions and save on royalty payments if it performs well. It also gets access to potential treatments for conditions such as pemphigus, a rare disease that attacks the skin.Still, investors face a long wait for returns. Principia is unlikely to make a decent operating profit until 2025, according to analysts at HC Wainwright & Co, who pencil in EBIT of $584 million in 2026. Tax that at Sanofi’s 22% tax rate, and the French drugmaker could expect to make a 13% return on its investment, which values Principia at $3.4 billion once cash is factored in.The relatively low-risk deal may help ease fears that Sanofi might squander its massive cash pile. The French group’s shares have risen 5% since Hudson announced his new strategy last December, and they are now valued at nearly 14 times forward earnings, a modest premium to peers, according to Refinitiv data. But with cash to spare and biotech valuations rich, Hudson’s challenge will be to stay disciplined."

Trillions of dollars of monetary and economic stimulus aimed at reducing the economic fallout for tens of millions of Americans out of work because of the coronavirus have driven the S&P 500 up more than 50% from its March 23 low, with the benchmark now up nearly 5% for 2020.Graphic: S&P 500 vs unemploymentWhile the pandemic has forced many restaurants and shops out of business, large supermarkets and retailers with strong online sales have grown. Thanks mostly to Amazon, the S&P 500 consumer discretionary index .SPLRCD has gained 23% in 2020, making it the second-strongest performer among 11 sector indexes, below technology.The information technology index .SPLRCT has jumped 25% year to date, lifted by Microsoft, Apple, Mastercard MA.N and other companies seeing stronger demand for their products and services as people staying at home do more shopping online.While some investors worry that the rally since March has been concentrated largely among tech companies, others have confidence that these stocks’ gains are justified as the pandemic leads to a sharp increase in online shopping, cloud computing and other uses of technology.“These are firms that have solid fundamentals that are superior to the broader market and will benefit from recent trends. We do not find that this high concentration is a source of systemic risk,” said Benjamin Jones, senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets.Graphic: S&P 500 sectors year to dateWith the U.S. corporate earnings season mostly completed, a record number of companies have beaten dramatically lowered estimates.

2020-8-19,"Roche, Regeneron link up to develop COVID-19 antibody cocktail",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL8N2FL0PD,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche ROG.S is adding its manufacturing muscle and global development expertise to Regeneron's REGN.O bid to create an antibody cocktail for COVID-19 that the Swiss and U.S. companies hope can be used to slow the pandemic. Regeneron, which expects data from REGN-COV2 in humans next month after it prevented and treated the disease in animals, would handle U.S. sales and Roche worldwide distribution should it win approval, the companies said on Wednesday. [nL4N2F72XE] [nL1N2F520D]Roche has one of the world’s largest antibody production operations, including U.S. facilities in San Francisco, and will boost overall capacity for REGN-COV2 by at least three and a half times, a feat Regeneron would have been hard pressed to accomplish alone.“This major collaboration with Roche provides important scale and global expertise to bring REGN-COV2 to many more patients in the United States and around the globe,” Regeneron Chief Executive Leonard Schleifer said.Roche’s move to join up with Regeneron comes after its own drug, Actemra, failed in a trial against COVID-19. [nL5N2F010O]The companies will fund and run ongoing late-stage Phase 3 prevention and earlier-stage Phase 1 healthy volunteer safety studies, as well as additional studies to evaluate REGN-COV2 in treating or preventing COVID-19.The medicine combines one Regeneron-made antibody and a second antibody isolated from humans who recovered from COVID-19.The combination is designed to bind to the spike protein used by the new coronavirus to gain access to human cells, limiting its ability to escape.The United States already has a $450 million deal for the cocktail in place, under the terms of which Regeneron will sell it around 70,000 to 300,000 potential treatment doses or 420,000 to 1.3 million prevention doses of REGN-COV2.In July, the U.S. Justice Department sent a letter clearing the way for drug companies, including Roche, to share information in order to increase manufacturing capacity for antibody treatments.

2020-8-25,AstraZeneca starts trial of COVID-19 antibody treatment,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2FR1SR,"(Reuters) - British drugmaker AstraZeneca AZN.L has begun testing an antibody-based cocktail for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19, adding to recent signs of progress on possible medical solutions to the disease caused by the novel coronavirus. The London-listed firm, already among the leading players in the global race to develop a successful vaccine, said the study would evaluate if AZD7442, a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), was safe and tolerable in up to 48 healthy participants between the ages of 18 and 55 years.If the UK-based early-stage trial, which has dosed its participants, shows AZD7442 is safe, AstraZeneca said it would proceed to test it as both a preventative treatment for COVID-19 and a medicine for patients who have it, in larger, mid-to-late-stage studies.AstraZeneca shares were up about 1% at 87 pounds ($114) in early trading.Development of mAbs to target the virus, an approach already being tested by Regeneron REGN.O, ELi Lilly LLY.N, Roche ROG.S and Molecular Partners MOLN.S, has been endorsed by leading scientists.mAbs mimic natural antibodies generated in the body to fight off infection and can be synthesised in the laboratory to treat diseases in patients. Current uses include treatment of some types of cancers.U.S. infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci has called them “almost a sure bet” against COVID-19, and AstraZeneca in June received $23.7 million in funding from U.S. government agencies to advance development of antibody-based treatments for COVID-19.“This combination of antibodies, coupled to our proprietary half-life extension technology, has the potential to improve both the effectiveness and durability of use in addition to reducing the likelihood of viral resistance,” said Astra’s executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D Mene Pangalos.Though vaccines are at the heart of the long-term fight against the pandemic, alternative treatments are also being advanced, and the United States on Sunday authorized use of recovered COVID-19 patients’ plasma to treat those who are ill.The Financial Times reported at the weekend that President Donald Trump’s administration was considering a fast-tracked approval of AstraZeneca’s COVID-19 vaccine before November’s elections."
2020-8-31,"GSK, partner Vir join race to find COVID-19 antibody treatment",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN25R1KF,"(Reuters) - GlaxoSmithKline and partner Vir Biotechnology have started testing their experimental antibody on early-stage COVID-19 patients, entering the race to find a winner in a promising class of antiviral drugs to combat the pandemic.The British drugmaker said on Monday the long-acting single injection will be tested on recently diagnosed high-risk cases for its ability to prevent hospitalization, typically a life threatening disease stage.GSK, which in April moved to invest $250 million in Vir and agreed to collaborate on the antibody, is behind some peers in developing the class.Regeneron, which is working on antibody manufacturing with Roche, expects initial data from ongoing trials of its COVID-19 two-antibody combination in September.Eli Lilly, working with biotech firm AbCellera, early this month started testing whether their antibody can prevent the infections in nursing homes. A separate trial testing the compound on recently diagnosed COVID patients may yield initial data in September or shortly after.“We’re coming into the clinic a little bit later and part of that is because we spent some time selecting what we believe will be a best-in-class antibody,” Vir Chief Executive George Scangos told Reuters.The antibody is designed to not only block the virus from invading cells but also to recruit immune cells to kill already infected cells, which would otherwise replicate the virus.It also has been altered to stay effective for several months on a single shot and to cling to a part of the virus’s outer spike protein that has shown no tendency to mutate.After testing the drug on an initial 20 U.S. participants over two weeks for safety, the trial will expand to 1,300 patients globally.GSK said initial results could be available by the end of the year, complete results during the first quarter of 2021, and early access to patients could be on the cards before June.GSK’s more prominent role so far in combating the pandemic has been in providing adjuvants, efficacy boosters that play a vital role in many vaccines.The global effort to develop a vaccine against the virus, which has so far claimed more than 800,000 lives globally, has seen recent launches of late-stage trials, but work on treatments has also gone into overdrive.While one approach has been to quell a dangerous overreaction of the immune system, known as cytokine storm, another has been to block the virus from invading cells with antibodies.Antibodies, part of the body’s adaptive immune system, are normally made by white blood cells in response to a foreign substance in the body.But pharma companies, also including AstraZeneca and Molecular Partners, are working on manufactured monoclonal antibodies, made in bioreactors from living cells, for a more targeted attack on the virus.Using plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients, which contains a range of antibodies, is a similar approach but it may be fraught with more complex logistics and less consistent quality than manufactured antibodies.In future studies, GSK and Vir plan to run more trials on their antibody’s ability to prevent the infection and treat patients that are already in hospital care. Later this year, they plan to start a trial of a second antibody from the collaboration."
2020-9-01,Sanofi says Kevzara drug fails as possible COVID-19 treatment,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN25S3R4,"PARIS (Reuters) - The rheumatoid arthritis drug Kevzara has failed as a COVID-19 treatment, French drugmaker Sanofi said on Tuesday following a similar flop of a Roche product.Sanofi said Kevzara - which it produces with partner Regeneron - had failed as a COVID-19 treatment after the latest set of trials in patients across the world showed adverse effects, and would be dropped for studies in this field.Sanofi said the trials had led in some cases to COVID-19 pneumonia infections and even death in a few cases.The two companies do not anticipate conducting further clinical studies of it, Sanofi added.Trials had shown that the drug did not help patients with less severe COVID-19, the companies had said in July.“Although this trial did not yield the results we hoped for, we are proud of the work that was achieved by the team to further our understanding of the potential use of Kevzara for the treatment of COVID-19,” said Sanofi’s global head of research and development, John Reed.“At Sanofi, we are committed to help combat the global COVID-19 pandemic, including developing vaccine candidates that can be manufactured at large scale,” he added.Pharmaceutical companies have been racing to develop treatments against the COVID-19 pandemic that has claimed more than 849,000 lives and crippled economies. (tmsnrt.rs/3aIRuz7)Last month, CEO Paul Hudson said Sanofi’s confidence in its coronavirus vaccine candidates had increased over the summer as the drugmaker prepared to start clinical trials.In July, Roche said its attempt to retool its rheumatoid arthritis drug Actemra/RoActemra to treat patients hospitalised with severe COVID-19-related pneumonia has failed in a late-stage trial."

2020-9-11,Special Report: Big Pharma wages stealth war on drug price watchdog,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-drugpricing-lobbying-special-repo/special-report-big-pharma-wages-stealth-war-on-drug-price-watchdog-idUSKBN2621IQ,"(Reuters) - As evidence grew this spring that the drug remdesivir was helping COVID-19 patients, some Wall Street investors bet on analysts’ estimates that its maker, Gilead Sciences Inc, could charge up to $10,000 for the treatment.Then a small but increasingly influential drug-pricing research organization, the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER), said the treatment only justified a price between $2,800 and $5,000. Shortly after, Gilead announced it would charge about $3,100 for a five-day treatment and $5,700 for ten days - in line with the ICER recommendation.The episode illustrates the growing power of the Boston-based nonprofit to hold down U.S. drug prices. Over the past five years, ICER has pressured drugmakers to lower the cost of nearly 100 drugs. It aims to play a similar role with emerging COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. Health insurers increasingly use ICER's fair-value analyses to limit access to expensive drugs or to negotiate steeper discounts with drugmakers. (For a graphic on drugs ICER has rated overpriced, click tmsnrt.rs/3hiYULv )The industry has moved aggressively to combat the threat to its profits in two ways: With open criticism of ICER’s formula and with a stealthier campaign to undermine its credibility through proxies, including veterans’ groups and organizations that claim to advocate for patients but have ties to the pharmaceutical industry, Reuters found in a review of industry connections and funding among groups targeting ICER.Two such groups – the Partnership to Improve Patient Care (PIPC) and Value our Health – are led by employees of Thorn Run Partners, a Washington-based lobbying and public relations firm that counts nearly a dozen drugmakers as clients. PIPC denied it is part of a larger industry-financed proxy campaign to undermine ICER’s impact. Thorn Run declined to comment, and Value Our Health did not respond to inquiries.As remdesivir gained momentum, PIPC complained to ICER in a June letter that its methodology, which examines how a drug improves patient quality of life, was unfair for COVID-19 drugs. It also held a webinar for patients criticizing ICER’s methods.The group’s chairman, former U.S. Democratic Representative Tony Coelho, argued in the letter that ICER’s methods yield a flawed value assessment for COVID-19 drugs that could lead insurers or government programs to limit coverage to the elderly and people with disabilities because ICER’s formula attributes a lower value to their medicines than those for healthier patients. In a statement to Reuters, Coelho attacked ICER’s formula as a flawed “one-size-fits-all assessment.”Gilead also pushed ICER for a higher price during its remdesivir review. The firm told Reuters that ICER’s assessment failed to consider savings from shorter hospital stays and underestimated how much insurers or the government would be willing to pay.Remdesivir is the only COVID-19 treatment ICER has assessed so far. Steven Pearson, a Harvard academic who started ICER, said it will likely review more coronavirus treatments if they make it to market, including potentially those being developed by Regeneron and Eli Lilly and Co that use antibodies to generate an immune response. The two companies declined to comment.ICER’s assessments are not used to deny care to patients based on their health, Pearson said. Rather, the formula helps insurers or government programs choose the most cost-effective treatment for a specific condition, based on its price and benefit in providing a better quality of life. Pearson pointed out that the formula has long been used in the health systems of countries including England, Canada, the Netherlands and Sweden.“We don’t think of them as hotbeds of discrimination against sick people,” he said, “and neither are we.”The industry has followed the same playbook before: soliciting criticism from outside groups - some of which it finances or staffs - to create the impression of a broad-based patient uprising against ICER’s pricing assessments rather than an industry push to protect profits.Last year, ICER invited input as it revamped its assessment methods. Two of more than 50 comment letters came from six California veterans’ groups, who blasted an ICER contract with the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), saying its formula denies veterans care and “inherently discriminates” against people with disabilities.But no one from the veterans’ groups wrote the complaints. Officials from the organizations told Reuters they lent their names to letters that were composed instead by Peter Conaty, the pharmaceutical industry’s go-to lobbyist in California. A half dozen health policy specialists told Reuters that the veterans’ complaints look like part of an “astroturf” campaign – a phony grassroots movement backed by corporate interests. Conaty did not respond to requests for comment.Such under-the-radar PR efforts underscore the industry’s determination to protect its pricing power in an era when expensive new drug therapies are increasingly under fire for their role in soaring U.S. healthcare costs. The battle for influence over drug prices could have far-reaching effects on consumers, insurers, employers and the government, industry and policy experts said.Matt Eyles, president of insurance lobby America’s Health Insurance Plans, said ICER plays a key role in holding down “out of control” drug prices. “Big Pharma is doing everything in its power - including pushing other groups to levy false claims of analytical bias and discrimination - to undermine ICER’s long history of independence and its commitment to bringing value into drug pricing.”The VA, which covers health care for more than 9 million people - veterans and their family members - started using ICER drug-value assessments in 2017 to negotiate lower prices with pharmaceutical firms. VA spokeswoman Ndidi Mojay said the agency uses ICER’s research for those negotiations but not to limit treatments. The VA strives to provide veterans the best possible care and taxpayers the best value, Mojay said.“ICER helps the department do just that,” she said.ICER uses a decades-old formula called the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) – the cost of one year of good health for one patient – to estimate fair value. European nations have long used QALY to guide their drug coverage, and ICER defends it as the gold standard.The organization is filling a void left by the federal government, which does not negotiate drug prices for Medicare, the healthcare program for disabled and older Americans, and Medicaid, which serves the poor. Pharmaceutical industry representatives say they fear that ICER is slowly taking over that function for the government and insurers. Congress banned the Medicare program from using QALY to evaluate drug prices in the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - after the industry lobbied for such a provision.The industry’s largest U.S. trade group - the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA - has publicly criticized ICER’s formula as undervaluing drugs, arguing it fails to consider certain patient benefits, such as the ability to return to work. Randy Burkholder, one of PhRMA’s top lobbyists, called the method “fundamentally and intractably” flawed in an interview. The National Pharmaceutical Council, an industry-financed research group, has regularly criticized ICER in the media, arguing drugmakers will invest less in future treatments if ICER’s recommendations limit prices.Groups including PIPC are parroting the industry arguments while claiming to represent patients - without disclosing their industry ties, according to a Reuters review of the groups’ press releases, blogs, webcasts and letters. Value our Health - which has been represented by Shea McCarthy, a Thorn Run public relations partner and lobbyist - is one of a half dozen organizations who has regularly flooded health and policy journalists with emails lambasting ICER.Sara van Geertruyden, PIPC’s executive director, is also a Thorn Run public relations partner. She said the group advocates for patients and denied that PIPC is a proxy for pharmaceutical-industry interests or that it has concealed its industry ties. She blasted ICER as a “payer-focused” organization delivering skewed assessments that allow insurers to deny patients access to drugs. “Is it any surprise patients would be concerned?” she asked.Nicole Longo, spokeswoman for the PhRMA trade group, did not answer detailed questions from Reuters about whether it was directing a campaign through proxies to undermine ICER. Longo provided PhRMA’s comments to ICER on its remdesivir pricing assessment, which called its methodology biased and “designed to devalue remdesivir and other COVID-19 treatments.”The National Pharmaceutical Council’s Interim Chief Executive Officer Robert DuBois said that it does not advocate or lobby for the drug industry. ICER’s methodology is an inaccurate measure that does not fully account for how a drug helps patients or society, he said.In January, after ICER called new sickle cell treatments too pricey in a draft report, Value our Health, PIPC and sickle-cell patient groups pushed patients and caregivers to report disease-related costs to ICER to “help ICER put a price tag” on sickle-cell expenses. ICER postponed the review process due to COVID-19 and has not issued a final report.Last fall, Reuters reported that CVS Health Corp, one of the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers, decided to scale back a new program for employers that would exclude coverage of drugs that ICER says are not cost effective. The move followed a pressure campaign by PIPC against CVS. At the time, CVS cited fierce criticism from patient groups as the reason for backtracking. CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said, in a statement to Reuters, that CVS still uses ICER’s analyses in a drug-coverage plan for its own employees and a small number of other clients.The PhRMA Foundation - the trade group’s nonprofit public health advocacy arm - has spent $3 million on research into alternative methods of determining a drug’s value, according to foundation announcements. Foundation President Eileen Cannon said that the foundation consults with PhRMA, the industry group, but makes decisions on academic grants independently.ICER responds to industry accusations of discrimination by arguing that its review process is flexible and considers additional measures besides QALY when warranted. As an example, ICER points to its verdict on Luxturna, an $850,000-per-patient gene therapy from Spark Therapeutics Inc, now part of Roche Holding AG. Luxturna improves the sight of children who have a rare genetic disease causing blindness. Though the QALY numbers did not support that price, ICER determined that Luxturna was cost-effective because it reduced the burden on the children’s’ caregivers.PhRMA director of policy Lauren Neves the Luxturna example was an exception to ICER’s typical practice.ICER started focusing on drug prices in 2015 and has since evaluated nearly 100 treatments, taking on those that insurers worry will raise overall health-care costs. ICER has considered only a handful of those therapies to be cost-effective at full list price, and only a third to be fairly priced after considering drugmaker discounts, according to data that ICER provided to Reuters.Big Pharma had its first big ICER problem in 2015 when the group recommended to health insurers that two new drugs to treat high cholesterol should cost about one-third of the manufacturers’ prices. The analysis prompted insurers to sharply limit use of the treatments and eventually forced drugmakers Amgen Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA to slash prices. The companies declined to comment.Today, the largest U.S. health insurers, such as Cigna Corp and CVS, use ICER findings to negotiate discounts. New York’s Medicaid program has used ICER to push drug companies to lower prices, and other states are considering it.In July, the New York state Medicaid board voted to demand that Biogen Inc sell its spinal muscular atrophy drug to the state at the ICER-prescribed price of about $77,000 for a typical year of treatments - an 80% discount off Biogen’s list price.Biogen spokeswoman Anna Robinson said that the firm disagreed with the steep discount and hoped to work with New York to ensure patients get the treatment.With fewer than 30 employees and a budget of about $6 million in 2018, ICER is bankrolled mostly by Houston billionaire John Arnold, the former Enron energy trader and hedge fund owner who has taken on drug-pricing as one of many philanthropic efforts. ICER also takes money from companies on both sides of the drug-pricing debate - insurers and pharma - but says that they together provide only about 20% of its revenue.Arnold told Reuters in an interview that he finances ICER because past efforts to foster independent drug-price analysis have been co-opted by the pharmaceutical industry and tainted by its money.“The status quo works very well in the industry, so it is important for them to label any proposed reform as something radical and something that won’t work,” he said. “There is not much debate about whether the system we have to price pharmaceutical drugs is broken.”ICER’s Pearson said the coronavirus pandemic has raised the importance of the organization’s work as the pricing of vaccines and treatments will impact millions of Americans amid a faltering economy.“There is a heightened public awareness and sensitivity to the risk of high prices being unfair,” he said."

European nations have long used QALY to guide their drug coverage, and ICER defends it as the gold standard.The organization is filling a void left by the federal government, which does not negotiate drug prices for Medicare, the healthcare program for disabled and older Americans, and Medicaid, which serves the poor. Pharmaceutical industry representatives say they fear that ICER is slowly taking over that function for the government and insurers. Congress banned the Medicare program from using QALY to evaluate drug prices in the 2010 Affordable Care Act - known as Obamacare - after the industry lobbied for such a provision.The industry’s largest U.S. trade group - the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, or PhRMA - has publicly criticized ICER’s formula as undervaluing drugs, arguing it fails to consider certain patient benefits, such as the ability to return to work. Randy Burkholder, one of PhRMA’s top lobbyists, called the method “fundamentally and intractably” flawed in an interview. The National Pharmaceutical Council, an industry-financed research group, has regularly criticized ICER in the media, arguing drugmakers will invest less in future treatments if ICER’s recommendations limit prices.Groups including PIPC are parroting the industry arguments while claiming to represent patients - without disclosing their industry ties, according to a Reuters review of the groups’ press releases, blogs, webcasts and letters. Value our Health - which has been represented by Shea McCarthy, a Thorn Run public relations partner and lobbyist - is one of a half dozen organizations who has regularly flooded health and policy journalists with emails lambasting ICER.Sara van Geertruyden, PIPC’s executive director, is also a Thorn Run public relations partner. She said the group advocates for patients and denied that PIPC is a proxy for pharmaceutical-industry interests or that it has concealed its industry ties. She blasted ICER as a “payer-focused” organization delivering skewed assessments that allow insurers to deny patients access to drugs. “Is it any surprise patients would be concerned?” she asked.Nicole Longo, spokeswoman for the PhRMA trade group, did not answer detailed questions from Reuters about whether it was directing a campaign through proxies to undermine ICER. Longo provided PhRMA’s comments to ICER on its remdesivir pricing assessment, which called its methodology biased and “designed to devalue remdesivir and other COVID-19 treatments.”The National Pharmaceutical Council’s Interim Chief Executive Officer Robert DuBois said that it does not advocate or lobby for the drug industry. ICER’s methodology is an inaccurate measure that does not fully account for how a drug helps patients or society, he said.In January, after ICER called new sickle cell treatments too pricey in a draft report, Value our Health, PIPC and sickle-cell patient groups pushed patients and caregivers to report disease-related costs to ICER to “help ICER put a price tag” on sickle-cell expenses. ICER postponed the review process due to COVID-19 and has not issued a final report.Last fall, Reuters reported that CVS Health Corp, one of the biggest U.S. pharmacy benefit managers, decided to scale back a new program for employers that would exclude coverage of drugs that ICER says are not cost effective. The move followed a pressure campaign by PIPC against CVS. At the time, CVS cited fierce criticism from patient groups as the reason for backtracking. CVS Chief Medical Officer Troy Brennan said, in a statement to Reuters, that CVS still uses ICER’s analyses in a drug-coverage plan for its own employees and a small number of other clients.The PhRMA Foundation - the trade group’s nonprofit public health advocacy arm - has spent $3 million on research into alternative methods of determining a drug’s value, according to foundation announcements. Foundation President Eileen Cannon said that the foundation consults with PhRMA, the industry group, but makes decisions on academic grants independently.ICER responds to industry accusations of discrimination by arguing that its review process is flexible and considers additional measures besides QALY when warranted. As an example, ICER points to its verdict on Luxturna, an $850,000-per-patient gene therapy from Spark Therapeutics Inc, now part of Roche Holding AG. Luxturna improves the sight of children who have a rare genetic disease causing blindness. Though the QALY numbers did not support that price, ICER determined that Luxturna was cost-effective because it reduced the burden on the children’s’ caregivers.PhRMA director of policy Lauren Neves the Luxturna example was an exception to ICER’s typical practice.ICER started focusing on drug prices in 2015 and has since evaluated nearly 100 treatments, taking on those that insurers worry will raise overall health-care costs. ICER has considered only a handful of those therapies to be cost-effective at full list price, and only a third to be fairly priced after considering drugmaker discounts, according to data that ICER provided to Reuters.Big Pharma had its first big ICER problem in 2015 when the group recommended to health insurers that two new drugs to treat high cholesterol should cost about one-third of the manufacturers’ prices. The analysis prompted insurers to sharply limit use of the treatments and eventually forced drugmakers Amgen Inc, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and Sanofi SA to slash prices. The companies declined to comment.Today, the largest U.S. health insurers, such as Cigna Corp and CVS, use ICER findings to negotiate discounts. New York’s Medicaid program has used ICER to push drug companies to lower prices, and other states are considering it.In July, the New York state Medicaid board voted to demand that Biogen Inc sell its spinal muscular atrophy drug to the state at the ICER-prescribed price of about $77,000 for a typical year of treatments - an 80% discount off Biogen’s list price.Biogen spokeswoman Anna Robinson said that the firm disagreed with the steep discount and hoped to work with New York to ensure patients get the treatment.With fewer than 30 employees and a budget of about $6 million in 2018, ICER is bankrolled mostly by Houston billionaire John Arnold, the former Enron energy trader and hedge fund owner who has taken on drug-pricing as one of many philanthropic efforts. ICER also takes money from companies on both sides of the drug-pricing debate - insurers and pharma - but says that they together provide only about 20% of its revenue.Arnold told Reuters in an interview that he finances ICER because past efforts to foster independent drug-price analysis have been co-opted by the pharmaceutical industry and tainted by its money.“The status quo works very well in the industry, so it is important for them to label any proposed reform as something radical and something that won’t work,” he said. “There is not much debate about whether the system we have to price pharmaceutical drugs is broken.”ICER’s Pearson said the coronavirus pandemic has raised the importance of the organization’s work as the pricing of vaccines and treatments will impact millions of Americans amid a faltering economy.“There is a heightened public awareness and sensitivity to the risk of high prices being unfair,” he said."
2020-9-14,Novartis says Beovu matched rival Eylea in visual acuity in eye disease,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSFWN2GB05K,"ZURICH, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Novartis on Monday said its eye drug Beovu matched rival Eylea from Regeneron in visual acuity at one year in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME), as the Swiss drugmaker seeks to regain momentum with the drug after early safety stumbles.“This data confirms our strong belief in Beovu as a potential therapy for DME patients,” said Dirk Sauer, who leads Novartis Pharma Ophthalmology’s drug development.Novartis earlier this year launched an external review into the safety of Beovu after the American Society of Retinal Specialists (ASRS) raised concerns about rare cases of sight-threatening inflammatory eye condition in patients with another eye disease, age-related macular degeneration.

2020-9-14,Regeneron\'s antibody drug added to UK Recovery trial of COVID treatments,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2651N0,"LONDON (Reuters) - The world's largest randomised trial of potential medicines for COVID-19 is to add Regeneron's REGN.O experimental antiviral antibody cocktail REGN-COV2 to the drugs it is testing in patients hospitalised with the disease.The UK RECOVERY trial, which has been testing a range of potential COVID-19 treatments since it began in April, will compare the effects of adding REGN-COV2 - a lab-manufactured monoclonal antibody - to standard care.“This is the first drug actually designed for this disease,” said Martin Landray, a professor of medicine & epidemiology at Oxford University who is co-leading the trial.“There are lots of good reasons for thinking this might be really quite a powerful treatment,” he told Reuters in an interview.The addition of Regeneron’s drug to the RECOVERY trial comes amid growing hopes that monoclonal antibodies may emerge as effective ways to treat COVID-19.Until now, the RECOVERY trial had mostly been studying whether existing drugs could be re-purposed to tackle the new disease, and it has already found answers on a number of them.In June and September, trial results showed that widely used steroids such as dexamethasone and hydrocortisone were able to reduce death rates among severely-ill COVID-19 patientsAlso in June, RECOVERY trial results showed that the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, once touted by U.S. President Donald Trump as a potential “game changer” in the pandemic, was of no benefit in treating COVID-19 patients.Regeneron’s REGN-COV2 cocktail, which the company is already testing in late-stage clinical trials in people, combines one Regeneron-made antibody and a second antibody isolated from people who have recovered after being infected with COVID-19.The combination is designed to bind to the spike protein used by the new coronavirus to gain access to human cells, limiting the virus’s ability to escape.Regeneron developed the biological drug before linking up with Roche ROG.S to expand its manufacturing capacity in hopes of meeting global demand, should the medicine prove effective. Regeneron would handle U.S. sales, with Roche selling the medicine around the world.Landray said his team had secured enough supply of the drug so that up to “several thousand” patients could be given it in the trial and compared with several thousand controls.“Given that the second phase (of COVID-19 infections in the UK) seems to be coming now, it is a really good time to be starting this,” he said.The United States already has a $450 million deal for the cocktail in place, under the terms of which Regeneron will sell it around 70,000 to 300,000 potential treatment doses or 420,000 to 1.3 million prevention doses of REGN-COV2. Data is due later this month, Regeneron has said.Alongside Regeneron, Eli Lilly LLY.N, working with biotech firm AbCellera, is seen as a leading contender in the antibody race. In August it started testing whether its antibody can prevent COVID-19 infections in nursing homes. A separate trial testing the compound on recently diagnosed COVID patients may yield initial data in September or shortly after.GlaxoSmithKline GSK.L and partner Vir Biotechnology VIR.O also began testing an experimental antibody on newly diagnosed COVID-19 patients late last month. AstraZeneca AZN.L is for now testing its antibody-based cocktail on healthy volunteers for tolerability."
2020-9-14,Novartis aims to expand Beovu use after safety fears hurt launch,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2650KG,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Novartis’s Beovu matched Regeneron’s Eylea in vision clarity scores for a blindness-causing eye disease, the Swiss drugmaker said on Monday, after early safety stumbles for the medicine in another condition caused disappointing early sales.In addition to proving non-inferior to Eylea in visual acuity in diabetic macular edema (DME) patients after a year of treatment, Novartis also underscored Beovu’s less-frequent dosing. More than half of those who got Beovu stayed on a once-every-three-months dosing schedule, it said in a statement, with Eylea patients dosed every two months.Novartis said it will assess next steps in getting approval for Beovu in DME.“This data confirms our strong belief in Beovu as a potential therapy for DME patients,” said Dirk Sauer, who leads Novartis Pharma Ophthalmology’s drug development.Beovu was approved in February for age-related macular degeneration, another blindness causing condition, but Novartis was forced just weeks later to launch an external safety review after the American Society of Retinal Specialists (ASRS) raised concerns about rare cases of sight-threatening retinal vasculitis or retinal vascular occlusion.While Beovu remains on sale and Novartis has promoted its favourable risk-benefit profile, the European Medicines Agency on Monday followed U.S. regulators in updating its safety label to include a special warning urging patients that experience such inflammatory events to discontinue use.Novartis, whose Chief Financial Officer Harry Kirsch in July said the sluggish Beovu launch was among factors that weighed on sales growth, is continuing to examine the cause of such adverse events, and how best to treat them when they arise."
2020-9-15,Roche executive says COVID-hit health systems at \'more or less\' normal capacity,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2661MU,"ZURICH (Reuters) - Many patients have overcome initial fears of COVID-19 infections and resumed doctor visits, Roche’s drug unit chief said, helping health systems even in hard-hit regions like Texas, Florida and California return to “more or less” normal capacity.Swiss-based Roche’s results this year have been dented as patients around the world shied away from hospitals and clinics during lockdowns, lowering demand for drugs including eye medicine Lucentis, multiple sclerosis drug Ocrevus and hemophilia medicine Hemlibra and leading to a 10% second-quarter sales decline.Bill Anderson, CEO of Roche’s main pharmaceuticals unit with about $50 billion in annual sales, said in an interview on Tuesday that most of the world’s health care systems have re-stabilized, “even in places that had reasonably high levels of COVID”.“In the month of August, you had places like Texas, Florida, California with a lot of infections,” Anderson told Reuters.“But we saw the health care system was more or less back at normal capacity. I think that was probably mostly a one-time thing, where people were really unsure, they were afraid to go out of the house, afraid to go to their family doctor, because maybe they would get COVID.”The public’s understanding of risks has grown since the pandemic began, he added, boosting their confidence to move more freely.Anderson’s description of recovering demand underpins Roche move this summer to stick to its original 2020 forecast -- for full-year sales to grow in the low- to mid-single-digit percentage range -- despite the second-quarter revenue tumble.Anderson did not give specific sales figures. Roche, which is expecting initial clinical trial data on the anti-COVID-19 drug it is developing with U.S.-based Regeneron this month, reports third-quarter sales on Oct. 15."
2020-9-16,"Lilly says antibody drug cuts COVID-19 hospitalization, may seek emergency use nod",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2671TA,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co LLY.N on Wednesday said a single infusion of its experimental antibody treatment reduced the need for hospitalization and emergency room visits for clinical trial patients with moderate COVID-19.The company said it will discuss the interim results, which have not yet been reviewed by outside experts, with global regulators. A Lilly spokeswoman said discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration are expected to range from additional clinical trials to the possibility of an emergency use authorization.The mid-stage study tested three different doses of LY-CoV555, a manufactured copy of a an antibody produced by a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Antibody treatments work by recognizing and locking onto foreign invaders to prevent infection of healthy cells.Of the total 302 patients treated with the Lilly drug, five or 1.7%, had to be hospitalized or required an emergency room visit. That compared with 6% in the placebo group, Lilly said.“These data are not a home run but ... are among the most encouraging COVID treatment data we’ve seen, particularly given this is in mild-to-moderate outpatients where there has simply been no treatment progress until now,” Raymond James analyst Steven Seedhouse said in a research note.Oddly, only the middle 2,800-milligram dose achieved the trial’s main goal of reducing the amount of virus detected in patients compared with a placebo 11 days after treatment. Lilly said most trial participants, including those given a placebo, had completely cleared the virus by day 11.“It’s clear that we need to look at impact on viral load at earlier timepoints or persistently high viral load,” the company said in an emailed statement.Most hospitalizations occurred in patients with underlying risk factors such as obesity or advanced age. Lilly said future study would focus on people in these higher-risk groups.No drug-related serious adverse events or trial deaths were reported.Lilly said the trial will enroll 800 patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19, with the next segment testing LY-CoV555 in combination with a second Lilly antibody, LY-CoV016, which binds to a different area of the virus.The antibodies, given by intravenous infusion, are also being tested for preventing COVID-19 in nursing home residents and staff and for treating patients already hospitalized with COVID-19.Several companies including Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc REGN.O and Vir Biotechnology VIR.O are also testing antibody treatments for COVID-19. Eli Lilly shares were up less than 1% to $151.28."
2020-9-17,"Lilly, Amgen partner to manufacture potential COVID-19 drugs",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL4N2GE2R3,"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co has partnered with Amgen Inc to increase the supply of its experimental COVID-19 antibody treatments, a day after one of the drugs was shown to reduce the need for hospitalization.Through the collaboration, the two companies will have the ability to scale up production should one or more of Lilly’s antibody therapies prove receive regulatory approval, the companies said in a statement.Eli Lilly on Wednesday reported that a single infusion of its experimental antibody treatment cut hospitalizations and emergency room visits for clinical trial patients with moderate COVID-19.“We are impressed with Lilly’s data, in particular the reduction in hospitalizations, and are enthusiastic about the potential for these neutralizing antibodies as a therapeutic for COVID-19,” David Reese, Amgen’s research and development chief, said in the statement.Eli Lilly had said it would discuss the interim data with global regulators, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and that discussions could also include the possibility of an emergency use authorization."
2020-9-17,South Korea approves Phase 2\\/3 trials of Celltrion COVID-19 antibody drug,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2681BQ,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea said on Thursday it has approved Celltrion Inc’s experimental COVID-19 treatment for Phase 2/3 clinical trials, as the firm plans to seek a conditional approval of the antibody drug for an emergency use.Celltrion has said it would begin commercial production of the drug, CT-P59, this month - likely to amount to around 1 million doses, in anticipation of demand in Korea and overseas.The treatment, the most advanced antibody drug in terms of research in South Korea, is directed against the surface of the virus and designed to block it from locking on to human cells.The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety said safety and efficacy of the drug were shown in the early stage of a trial, and a Phase 2/3 study will be offered to 1,020 participants.Other companies developing potential COVID-19 treatments include Eli Lilly and Co, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and AbbVie.Celltrion said human trials of the treatment will be carried out in 12 countries including Britain, Spain and the United States, and it anticipates primary results by the end of the year."
2020-9-29,"Regeneron says its COVID-19 treatment reduces viral levels, improves symptoms",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN26K3GE,"(Reuters) - Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc on Tuesday said its experimental two-antibody cocktail reduced viral levels and improved symptoms in non-hospitalized COVID-19 patients, enhancing its chances of becoming a treatment for the disease that has killed over a million people worldwide.“We hope these data will support an EUA” (emergency use authorization) from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Regeneron Chief Scientific Officer George Yancopoulos said on a conference call.The FDA can authorize emergency use of a drug before completing its review for a formal approval.The treatment, REGN-COV2, is also being studied for use in hospitalized patients, and for prevention of infection in people who have been exposed to COVID-19. Regeneron declined to comment on when those trial results are expected.“It is unclear, though possible, that the Regeneron cocktail could work in a hospital setting where the patient is already severely ill and has a high viral load,” Jefferies analyst Michael Yee said in a research note.Yancopoulos said that in order for REGN-COV2 to be used in the studied patient population - people with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 - routine diagnostic tests would be needed. Therapeutic use “is going to depend on having the right diagnostic tools available,” he said.Shares of Regeneron were up 2% at $585.40 after hours.Trial results for the first 275 patients showed the biggest effect in patients who did not create high levels of their own antibodies against the virus. That suggests the REGN-COV2 could help patients whose own immune system is not strong enough to combat the virus, Regeneron said.The drug is part of a class of biotech therapies known as monoclonal antibodies. Several companies are using the technology to manufacture copies of human antibodies to the new coronavirus.Regeneron believes its dual-antibody formula will limit the ability of the virus to escape detection and attack.Eli Lilly & Co earlier this month released data showing that one of its monoclonal antibodies lowered patient virus levels and could reduce the need for patients to be hospitalized.Regeneron tested two different doses of REGN-COV2 in two patient populations: those who had mounted an effective immune response on their own (seropositive), and those whose immune response was not yet adequate (seronegative).In seronegative patients, the median time to symptom relief was 13 days for the placebo group, 8 days for the high-dose group and 6 days for the low-dose group.Regeneron said REGN-COV2 rapidly reduced virus levels in seronegative patients. In addition, patients with higher virus levels at the start of the trial had correspondingly greater reductions in viral load with REGN-COV2, which is given by intravenous infusion.“The data are favorable for seronegative patients,” Yee said.The U.S. government in June awarded Regeneron a $450 million supply contract for up to 300,000 doses of the antibody cocktail.Swiss drugmaker Roche Holding AG last month agreed to boost overall manufacturing capacity for REGN-COV2 by at least three-and-a-half times. Under the deal, Regeneron would handle U.S. sales of the treatment and Roche would be responsible for the rest of the world."

Around 35% of patients infected by the variant form had very high levels of the virus in their samples, compared to 10% of patients without the variant, study leader Michael Kidd of Public Health England and Birmingham University told Reuters. Higher viral loads have been linked with worse COVID-19 outcomes. The tests were conducted at the Birmingham Turnkey Lab. Kidd said additional study was needed to confirm or refute the findings. If confirmed, he hopes scientists will investigate how this particular variant manages to make more copies of itself in infected patients. (bit.ly/3nUEJrr)Neanderthal gene protects against COVID-19A specific form of a protein passed down from Neanderthals protects against severe COVID-19, and medications that boost levels of this protein could potentially help treat the disease, according to a study reported on medRxiv on Thursday ahead of peer review. The protein, called OAS1, is involved in the body's response to viruses. People with higher levels of the Neanderthal-related form of OAS1 are less susceptible to COVID-19, and if they do become infected, they are at lower risk for hospitalization, intubation and death, the researchers found. ""This protective form of OAS1 is present in sub-Saharan Africans but was lost when the ancestors of modern-day Europeans migrated out of Africa. It was then re-introduced into the European population through mating with Neanderthals"" who lived more than 40,000 years ago, said coauthor Brent Richards from the Jewish General Hospital and McGill University in Montreal. An earlier study linked a cluster of genes inherited from Neanderthals to higher risks of hospitalization from COVID-19. ""These findings further implicate Neanderthal ancestry in COVID-19 severity,"" Richards said. (bit.ly/2KxrQVP)Early antibody production key to COVID-19 recoveryThe speed of patients' antibody production - rather than the volume of antibodies they produce to fight the new coronavirus - determines whether they will survive COVID-19, new data suggest. Researchers who studied more than 200 COVID-19 patients, including 179 who were hospitalized, found those who produced so-called neutralizing antibodies within 14 days of developing symptoms eventually recovered, while those who did not produce neutralizing antibodies until more than 14 days had elapsed developed higher viral loads and more severe disease. ""It is unclear why antibodies generated after this time point are unable to promote viral clearance and recovery in COVID-19 patients,"" the researchers said in a report posted on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Study leader Akiko Iwasaki of the Yale University School of Medicine tweeted on Saturday, ""It's possible that virus somehow becomes resistant by hiding in inaccessible tissues."" The new findings, she added, suggest therapy with so-called monoclonal antibody drugs - such as those from Regeneron given to U.S. President Donald Trump -- is likely to work only if used soon after infection.

2021-1-07,"Roche, Sanofi arthritis drugs reduce death rates among sickest COVID-19 patients",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL1N2JI1RW,"* “They are both lifesaving drugs,” says study co-leader* Actemra, Kevzara cut patients’ time in intensive care* Britain asks doctors to start using them immediately (Adds statement from UK government, bullet points)LONDON, Jan 7 (Reuters) - Treating critically ill COVID-19 patients with Roche’s Actemra or Sanofi’s Kevzara arthritis drugs significantly improves survival rates and reduces the amount of time patients need intensive care, study results showed on Thursday.The findings, which have not yet been peer-reviewed, showed that the immunosuppressive drugs - Actemra, also known as tocilizumab, and Kevzara, also known as sarilumab - reduced death rates by 8.5 percentage points among patients hospitalised and severely ill with the pandemic disease.That would mean that for every 12 patients treated with one of the two drugs, an extra life would be saved, said Anthony Gordon, an Imperial College London professor of anaesthesia and critical care who co-led the study. The data will boost confidence that some existing drugs can be repurposed to help with the pandemic that has killed more than 1.87 million people and crushed global economies.It also comes as countries struggle to contain two variants of the virus found in South Africa and Britain that are more transmissible and have driven a surge in infections.The UK government said it would ask doctors treating critically ill COVID-19 patients in hospital intensive care units to begin using the drugs immediately.“This is a significant step forward for increasing survival of patients,” the UK’s deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said in a statement.He said the drugs would be “crucial for helping to relieve pressure on intensive care and hospitals and saving lives”.Drug companies have been scouring their existing portfolios for possible therapies. So far the generic steroid dexamethasone and Gilead’s antiviral drug remdesivir have been approved for treating patients with severe symptoms.The United States has also authorised emergency use of some antibody drugs for non-hospitalised COVID-19 patients.The data, from around 800 severely ill COVID-19 patients involved in an international study known as the REMAP-CAP trial showed that the two drugs reduced mortality rates from 35.8% in a control group to 27.3% among patients receiving either tocilizumab or sarilumab.“That’s a big change in survival,” said Gordon. “They are both lifesaving drugs.”The results also showed that on average, patients treated with Actemra or Kevzara recovered more swiftly and were able to be discharged from intensive care units around seven to 10 days earlier than those who did not get these drugs.“This ... could have immediate implications for the sickest patients with COVID-19,” Gordon said. “We’re seeing the actual benefit in terms of survival and quicker recovery.”Until now, results for Actemra and Kevzara - both a type of drug known as IL-6 receptor antagonists - in treatment trials in patients with COVID-19 have been mixed.Sanofi said in September that Kevzara - which it produces with partner Regeneron - failed to meet the main goals of a U.S. study testing it in critically ill COVID-19 patients.In November, Roche said research showed Actemra helped the sickest COVID-19 patients, but it was unclear if it kept people alive or shortened how long they needed intensive care support such as mechanical ventilation, or both.Gordon noted on Thursday that previous studies had found no clear benefit, but said those trials had included less severely ill patients and started treatment at different stages in the disease course.“A crucial difference may be that in our study, critically ill patients were enrolled within 24 hours of starting organ support,” he said. “This highlights a potential early window for treatment where the sickest patients may gain the most benefit from immune modulation treatment.”Thursday’s trial data have not yet been peer-reviewed but were published online on the medRxiv website.

2021-1-08,Pfizer\\/BioNTech vaccine works against virus variants in lab; arthritis drugs improve COVID-19 survival,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN29B2TS,"(Reuters) -The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine protects against virus variantsThe COVID-19 vaccine from Pfizer Inc and BioNTech SE appears to protect against highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus discovered in Britain and South Africa, a laboratory study suggests. In blood samples from vaccine recipients, scientists found the vaccine appears effective against the so-called N501Y mutation of the spike protein on the virus, according to a report posted on Thursday on bioRxiv ahead of peer review. Pfizer scientist Phil Dormitzer said the vaccine has been tested against 16 mutations, and none have really had any significant impact. ""That's the good news,"" he said, before adding a note of caution. ""That doesn't mean that the 17th won't."" Ongoing testing will be needed, experts said, to allay concerns about whether the vaccines will be protective as the virus mutates. The vaccine is based on synthetic messenger RNA technology (mRNA), as is the one from Moderna Inc. ""The evidence is not conclusive but there is a lot to indicate that the existing mRNA vaccines do cover the new variants,"" said Andreas Bergthaler of the Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences in Vienna.

Monitoring by the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System jointly run by the two agencies detected only 21 cases of the life-threatening allergic reaction known as anaphylaxis among the nearly 1.9 million first doses of the vaccine administered between Dec. 14 and Dec. 23. Most people with anaphylaxis had a history of allergies or allergic reactions, according to the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report. For 71% of those with anaphylaxis, the allergic reactions occurred within 15 minutes. The agencies also received reports of 83 cases of less serious allergic reactions, including rashes, itchy skin, scratchy sensations in the throat, and mild respiratory symptoms. The CDC and FDA say they will continue to work together ""to monitor for adverse events ... after receipt of COVID-19 vaccines and will regularly assess the benefits and risks of vaccination.""

The company on Tuesday also presented early data from a late-stage trial showing that its combination therapy of two antibodies, bamlanivimab and etesevimab, helped cut the risk of hospitalization and death in COVID-19 patients by 70%.Bamlanivimab was authorized in November for emergency use in high-risk patients in the United States with mild to moderate COVID-19. Lilly has requested emergency use authorization for the combination as well. The new antibody targeting the South Africa variant is swiftly moving toward human testing, according to a company executive. How much data is needed each time a new antibody is made remains unresolved, he said. There has been considerable concern in recent weeks after highly transmissible new variants of the coronavirus were found in the United Kingdom and South Africa, raising alarm that current drugs and vaccines might be rendered less effective.""According to all of the publicly available surveillance... bamlanivimab alone is effective, or predicted to be effective against more than 99% of all strains that we see in the United States today. And bamlanivimab plus etesevimab should take care of the rest of them,"" Chief Scientific Officer Dan Skovronsky said.    ""That includes the U.K. variant, which is very highly transmissible,"" Skovronsky said.Data from over 1,000 participants in a late-stage study testing the combination showed 11 COVID-19-related hospitalizations and deaths in patients treated with the therapy, compared with 36 in those on placebo, representing a 70% risk reduction, the company said.Antibody therapies from Lilly and rival Regeneron (REGN.O) have so far seen lackluster demand as they require quick diagnosis and the isolation of infectious patients.  read more Lilly said it was working with the U.S. health regulator to potentially reduce infusion time for its antibody therapies to be as short as 16 minutes from the currently authorized time of 1 hour to simplify their use.

2021-2-26,AstraZeneca-Amgen drug could widen treatment options for severe asthma,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2AQ21L,"(Reuters) - AstraZeneca and Amgen’s experimental drug reduced asthma attacks in patients with severe and uncontrolled forms of the respiratory condition in a large study, showing promise for wider use against different triggers.The medicine, tezepelumab, cut the rate of asthma attacks by 56% among patients when compared to placebo in a year-long late-stage study, which had roughly 1,000 patients who were already receiving standard care, the drugmakers said on Friday.It also worked in a subgroup of volunteers with low levels of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell, detailed data presented at a virtual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology showed.The drug cut the risk of exacerbations by 70% in patients with more than or equal to 300 eosinophils per microlitre of blood, which is the baseline, by 41% in those with less than 300 cells, and 39% with less than 150 cells.Eosinophils are associated with swelling and narrowing of airways that could make asthma attacks worse. The respiratory condition can be triggered and turn severe by many factors, including eosinophil count and allergies.Tezepelumab works by blocking a type of immune protein called TSLP, found in the linings of the lungs. TSLP belongs to the cytokine group responsible for sounding an alarm to the body’s immune system and can also trigger inflammation.The biologic drug, if approved, will compete with AstraZeneca’s own Fasenra and Regeneron’s Dupixent.AstraZeneca’s Fasenra, which garnered almost $1 billion in sales last year, is a strong contender in the market to treat severe eosinophilic asthma, but tezepelumab would help the company branch out to treat non-eosinophilic patients.“Alongside Fasenra, we think that having two really strong complimentary, robust biologics in this space will actually expand use in eligible patients,” Richard Marshall, global head of late respiratory and immunology at AstraZeneca told Reuters.Tezepelumab also improved lung function in patients, helped control asthma better and cut the risk of hospitalisations or emergency visits by 79%, data showed.AstraZeneca’s Marshall said the study results will form part of regulatory submissions expected in the first half of 2021.Roughly 339 million people suffer from asthma worldwide, 10% of whom have severe forms of the condition."

The company did not report a quarterly profit.Diagnostics sales, driven by demand for COVID-19 tests for everything from active infections to antibodies in people who have recovered, rose 55% to 4.3 billion francs. That contrasts with the drug business, where sales slipped 9% to 10.6 billion francs.Schwan still sees current-year overall sales growth in the low- to mid-single-digit range at constant exchange rates, with similar core earnings per share growth, helped in part as COVID-19 testing demand remains robust in months to come.PANDEMIC PORTFOLIORoche's pandemic portfolio was lifted by Actemra, an arthritis drug repurposed for COVID-19 pneumonia whose revenue rose 22% to 779 million francs, and an anti-COVID-19 antibody cocktail that reaped 166 million francs.Some positive pandemic news actually resulted in a setback for Roche's trial aspirations.The company delayed a study of its anti-COVID-19 oral pill in Britain, because rising vaccination rates have checked infections and made finding patients harder.

It also plans to facilitate partnerships among pharmaceutical companies to quickly address possible bottlenecks in the supply chain."

The vast majority, though not all, were free of the virus at the start of the trial.Results for a subset of participants who were not infected to begin with was more encouraging but the primary analysis rested on results from all participants.""While this trial did not meet the primary endpoint against symptomatic illness, we are encouraged by the protection seen in the PCR negative participants following treatment with AZD7442,"" AstraZeneca Executive Vice President Mene Pangalos said in a statement, referring to the polymerase chain reaction tests which diagnose COVID-19.The company is banking on further studies to revive the product's fortunes.

2021-6-16,COVID SCIENCE-Regeneron antibodies help asymptomatic and hospitalized patients; some lymph node cancers limit vaccine response,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2NY26B,"June 16 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.Regeneron COVID-19 drug helps hardly sick and hospitalized patientsAn antibody cocktail from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) and Roche (ROG.S) showed benefits for a wide range of COVID-19 patients, from those without symptoms to hospitalized patients whose immune systems have not mounted a natural antibody response to the virus, two research teams reported on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The cocktail, REGEN-COV, is already being used intravenously in the United States to keep symptomatic COVID-19 patients out of the hospital. In a large new trial in U.S. adults and adolescents with coronavirus detected in the nose but no symptoms, researchers compared the effects of a single under-the-skin injection of the drug to a placebo. The results, released on Monday, showed the treatment cut patients' risk of developing symptoms by 32%. It also reduced the amount of virus patients carry, said study leader Meagan O'Brien of Regeneron. When symptoms did develop, they resolved five-to-six days faster with the drug. No one who got the drug required an emergency room visit or hospitalization, compared to six people in the placebo group. In a separate study from the UK released on Wednesday, intravenous treatment with REGEN-COV reduced the risk of death in hospitalized patients whose immune systems had not produced antibodies to the coronavirus. Treatment also shortened these patients' hospital stays and reduced their odds of needing mechanical ventilation. No benefit was seen, however, in patients who already had their own antibodies. (https://bit.ly/3iM3qqb; https://bit.ly/3zwiqyp; https://reut.rs/3iIw7Es)Some lymph node cancers limit COVID-19 vaccine responsesSome patients with lymph node cancers will have good antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines, but others will need further protection, according to new data. The UK PROSECO study tested antibody levels in 129 lymphoma patients after their first and/or second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N),   or AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccines. Responses were mixed, researchers reported on Saturday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Patients vaccinated during or within six months after treatment for their blood cancer were unlikely to develop good antibody responses, researchers found. These patients need to be revaccinated, said study leader Dr. Sean Hua Lim of the University of Southampton. Among patients who had never received treatment, or who had completed treatment more than six months prior, those with curable lymphomas responded well to the vaccine. All five with Hodgkin lymphoma, and seven of eight with aggressive B-cell lymphomas developed strong antibody responses. But 18 of 36 patients with incurable indolent lymphomas, like follicular lymphoma, had lower antibody levels than other patient groups. For these patients, ""further measures such as boosting with a different vaccine, or prophylactic treatment with antibodies should be considered,"" Lim said. (https://bit.ly/3iJewvZ)Coronavirus may have been in U.S. in late DecemberAt least seven people in five U.S. states were infected with the novel coronavirus weeks before the states reported their first cases, a large government study suggests. Researchers who analyzed more than 24,000 blood samples taken for a National Institutes of Health research program between Jan. 2 and March 18, 2020 found that samples showing antibodies to the coronavirus came as early as Jan. 7 from participants in Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. They do not know whether people with positive samples became infected during travel or while in their own communities. They do know, however, that people with antibodies were likely exposed to the virus weeks before their sample was taken, as antibodies do not appear until about two weeks of infection, according to a report published on Tuesday in Clinical Infectious Diseases. The data suggest the virus was in U.S. states far from the initial hotspots and areas that were considered its points of entry into the country, the authors said. The researchers followed U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for minimizing false-positive results. Experts not involved in the study said more research is needed to confirm that the positive early samples are not due to common cold antibodies.

The 431 study participants all received influenza vaccines manufactured by Seqirus, a unit of CSL Ltd (CSL.AX). They also received either the not-yet-approved COVID-19 vaccine from Novavax Inc (NVAX.O), which has been highly effective in clinical trials, or a placebo. The results, posted on Sunday on medRxiv and submitted for review to The Lancet, suggest the two vaccines do not interfere with each other.

2021-6-16,Regeneron antibodies help asymptomatic and hospitalized patients; some lymph node cancers limit vaccine response,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKCN2DS2AA,"June 16 (Reuters) - The following is a roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.Regeneron COVID-19 drug helps hardly sick and hospitalized patientsAn antibody cocktail from Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O) and Roche (ROG.S) showed benefits for a wide range of COVID-19 patients, from those without symptoms to hospitalized patients whose immune systems have not mounted a natural antibody response to the virus, two research teams reported on medRxiv ahead of peer review. The cocktail, REGEN-COV, is already being used intravenously in the United States to keep symptomatic COVID-19 patients out of the hospital. In a large new trial in U.S. adults and adolescents with coronavirus detected in the nose but no symptoms, researchers compared the effects of a single under-the-skin injection of the drug to a placebo. The results, released on Monday, showed the treatment cut patients' risk of developing symptoms by 32%. It also reduced the amount of virus patients carry, said study leader Meagan O'Brien of Regeneron. When symptoms did develop, they resolved five-to-six days faster with the drug. No one who got the drug required an emergency room visit or hospitalization, compared to six people in the placebo group. In a separate study from the UK released on Wednesday, intravenous treatment with REGEN-COV reduced the risk of death in hospitalized patients whose immune systems had not produced antibodies to the coronavirus. Treatment also shortened these patients' hospital stays and reduced their odds of needing mechanical ventilation. No benefit was seen, however, in patients who already had their own antibodies. (https://bit.ly/3iM3qqb; https://bit.ly/3zwiqyp; https://reut.rs/3iIw7Es)Some lymph node cancers limit COVID-19 vaccine responsesSome patients with lymph node cancers will have good antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines, but others will need further protection, according to new data. The UK PROSECO study tested antibody levels in 129 lymphoma patients after their first and/or second dose of the Pfizer/BioNTech (PFE.N),   or AstraZeneca (AZN.L) vaccines. Responses were mixed, researchers reported on Saturday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Patients vaccinated during or within six months after treatment for their blood cancer were unlikely to develop good antibody responses, researchers found. These patients need to be revaccinated, said study leader Dr. Sean Hua Lim of the University of Southampton. Among patients who had never received treatment, or who had completed treatment more than six months prior, those with curable lymphomas responded well to the vaccine. All five with Hodgkin lymphoma, and seven of eight with aggressive B-cell lymphomas developed strong antibody responses. But 18 of 36 patients with incurable indolent lymphomas, like follicular lymphoma, had lower antibody levels than other patient groups. For these patients, ""further measures such as boosting with a different vaccine, or prophylactic treatment with antibodies should be considered,"" Lim said. (https://bit.ly/3iJewvZ)Coronavirus may have been in U.S. in late DecemberAt least seven people in five U.S. states were infected with the novel coronavirus weeks before the states reported their first cases, a large government study suggests. Researchers who analyzed more than 24,000 blood samples taken for a National Institutes of Health research program between Jan. 2 and March 18, 2020 found that samples showing antibodies to the coronavirus came as early as Jan. 7 from participants in Illinois, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. They do not know whether people with positive samples became infected during travel or while in their own communities. They do know, however, that people with antibodies were likely exposed to the virus weeks before their sample was taken, as antibodies do not appear until about two weeks of infection, according to a report published on Tuesday in Clinical Infectious Diseases. The data suggest the virus was in U.S. states far from the initial hotspots and areas that were considered its points of entry into the country, the authors said. The researchers followed U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for minimizing false-positive results. Experts not involved in the study said more research is needed to confirm that the positive early samples are not due to common cold antibodies.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump was treated by an antibody cocktail by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O) in October after he tested positive for COVID-19.The latest study included three of the four variants that have been designated ""variants of concern"" by the World Health Organization, including Alpha, first identified in the UK, Beta, first found in South Africa and Gamma found in Brazil, as well as an emerging variant from India similar to the Delta variant of concern.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration in April revoked the emergency use authorization of Eli Lilly's (LLY.N) single antibody therapy, bamlanivimab, saying there was increased circulation of variants resistant to the therapy when used alone.  read more Other studies have previously shown that some antibody combination therapies remained potent against those emerging variants of the coronavirus that were resistant to single antibody therapies.The latest study found that combinations of two antibodies often retained potency against variants even when one of the two antibodies lost some or all ability to neutralize the variant in lab studies.The study, which was conducted in mice and hamsters, tested all single and combination antibody therapies authorized for emergency use by the FDA against emerging international and U.S. variants of the virus.The researchers evaluated the FDA authorized combination therapies made by Regeneron, Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and a single antibody therapy, sotrovimab, by Vir Biotechnology Inc (VIR.O) and GlaxoSmithKline Plc(GSK.L).They also assessed the antibodies currently in clinical trials by AbbVie Inc (ABBV.N), Vir and AstraZeneca (AZN.L).“Resistance arose with some of the monotherapies, but never with combination therapy,” study co-author Jacco Boon wrote.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2021-6-29,Growth stock comeback fuels Cathie Wood\'s ARK funds,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2N2OA1Z5,"NEW YORK, June 29 (Reuters) - A more than 10% surge in growth stocks since the start of the quarter is fueling a comeback in star stock picker Cathie Wood's ARK funds, which posted some of the worst declines among all U.S. equity funds over the first three months of the year.The ARK Innovation fund (ARKK.P), which is managed by firm founder Wood, gained 3.5% on Monday and is now up 4.3% for the year to date, highlighting a nearly 31% comeback since hitting its May 13 low. Prior to its recent rally, the fund had been down by as much as 9% for the year.Driving the gains are declining fears of runaway inflation and the failure of U.S. bond yields to follow through on their dramatic first-quarter rally, accelerating a rotation back in to the sort of hyper-growth stocks that helped Wood post the best returns of all actively managed mutual fund managers in 2020 tracked by Morningstar.Monday's move was also helped by breakthroughs in gene editing announced on Saturday which boosted the shares of several biotech companies Wood's firm holds in several of its funds, including its flagship Ark Innovation fund.""Investors have been rewarded for staying loyal to ARK and their long-term growth strategies as fears of rising interest rates were diminished,"" said Todd Rosenbluth, director of mutual fund research at CFRA. ""ARKK has significantly outperformed the broader market in the past month and is now in the black after being down double digits.""Among Wood's holdings are Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc (REGN.O), which is up 22.1% since its March low, and Intellia Therapeutics Inc (NTLA.O), which rallied more than 50% on Monday after posting positive interim data over the weekend from its ongoing early-stage trial for its genome editing candidate, NTLA-2001.Overall, the Russell 1000 Growth index (.RLG) is up 11.4% since the start of the quarter, nearly triple the 4.6% gain in the Russell 1000 Value index (.RLV) over the same time. Those gains have come as the price of lumber and other commodities has  fallen from multi-year peaks, helping ease investor concerns over spiking inflation.The Federal Reserve took many investors by surprise with a more hawkish turn at its most recent policy meeting, sending the yield of the benchmark 10-year Treasury below 1.5% on expectations that the central bank would be less tolerant of rising inflation. That has helped bolster tech and growth stocks, as rising yields threaten to erode the value of their longer-term cash flows.Despite ARK's recent gains, the performance of its flagship fund remains in the bottom 100th percentile among U.S. mid-cap growth funds, according to Morningstar data.Whether the fund continues its recent hot streak will largely depend on the direction of the 10-year Treasury yield, said Jim Paulsen, chief investment strategist at the Leuthold Group.""There's a high correlation between the 10-year and whether it's growth or value overall,"" as lower yields eat in to the profits of cyclical stocks such as financials, he said. While growth stocks are outperforming now, Paulsen remains skeptical the rally will continue.""Growth is going to be really strong in the economy this year and next and I don't think we have seen the last of the inflation scare,"" he said.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

2021-8-20,"AstraZeneca\'s antibody therapy prevents COVID-19, study shows",https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2FL0J6,"Aug 20 (Reuters) - Trial data from AstraZeneca (AZN.L) on Friday raised the prospect of a new treatment to prevent COVID-19 beyond vaccines, giving hope in particular for people who respond poorly to immunisation shots.The British drugmaker said its new antibody therapy reduced the risk of people developing any COVID-19 symptoms by 77% in a late-stage trial.While vaccines rely on an intact immune system to develop an arsenal of targeted antibodies and infection-fighting cells, AstraZeneca's AZD7442 therapy consists of lab-made antibodies that are designed to linger in the body for months to stifle the coronavirus in case of an infection.The company said that 75% of the participants in the trial for the therapy - which comprises two types of antibodies discovered by Vanderbilt University Medical Center in the United States - had chronic conditions including some with a lower immune response to vaccinations.Similar therapies made with a drug class called monoclonal antibodies are being developed by Regeneron (REGN.O), Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK.L) with partner Vir (VIR.O), competing for a role in COVID treatment and prevention.But AstraZeneca is first to publish positive prevention trial data in the field and is now targeting conditional approval in major markets well before the end of the year, aiming to produce roughly 1 to 2 million doses by then.Penny Ward, Visiting Professor in Pharmaceutical Medicine at Kings College in London, said the news bode well for people who have responded poorly to vaccination or who must take immune-suppressants for post-transplant, autoimmune disease and other conditions.""It could potentially be game changing for these individuals, who are currently being advised to continue to shield despite being fully vaccinated,"" she said.The good news on the therapy was tempered, however, by a separate AstraZeneca statement on Friday.It said a trial of a treatment for the rare neurological disorder amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), developed by AstraZeneca's newly acquired Alexion, had been stopped early due to a lack of efficacy.  read more AstraZeneca shares were up just 0.1% at 1400 GMT.AstraZeneca executive Mene Pangalos said the therapy trial results were taken three months after the antibodies were injected and investigators would follow up as far out as 15 months in the hope the company can tout the shot as a year-long shield.""We’re really trying to help patients that need an added level of protection on top of a vaccine,"" said Pangalos.He signalled that the prospects of a new COVID-19 product in AstraZeneca's medicine cabinet could also enhance the strategic value of its existing vaccine Vaxzevria, which it developed in collaboration with Britain's Oxford University.  read more ""No other company has delivered two molecules against SARS-CoV2. This definitely helps us in positioning us in terms of COVID,"" Pangalos told Reuters. SARS-CoV2 is the scientific term for the coronavirus that causes COVID-19.Another leading AstraZeneca executive, Ruud Dobber, had said last month that different strategic options were being explored for AstraZeneca's vaccine operations, which have faced a string of challenges.  read more APPROVAL TARGETSThe Anglo-Swedish drugmaker has suffered production problems during the rollout of Vaxzevria while very rare cases of blood clotting have weighed heavily on demand for the shot in Europe. The vaccine has also yet to win clearance in the United States.Concerns over the new Delta variant of COVID-19 and waning vaccine efficacy have prompted several high-income countries to offer a third vaccine shot on top of the usual two-shot regimen to the immunocompromised and other groups at risk.The immunocompromised, such as those with organ transplants or in cancer care, make up about 2% of the population and would be the main target group for the new therapy. Naval forces on missions could also benefit, among others, Pangalos said.Even though only 12% to 13% of the trial volunteers were vaccinated when the therapy trial data was generated, AstraZeneca will seek to position the shot as a top-up to previous inoculations.One or two manufacturing sites at as-yet undisclosed locations would serve world demand, said Pangalos, adding that AstraZeneca stood ready to boost production if countries or international organisations placed bulk orders.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

The plan depends upon a thumbs up from the FDA and an advisory panel to the CDC.  read more ""We want to make sure we stay ahead of the virus,"" Zients said, adding that ""the plan is pending the FDA conducting an independent evaluation and outside experts... issuing a booster dose recommendation.""Fauci added that healthcare providers should also make more use of COVID-19 antibody treatments, including those from Eli Lilly & Co (LLY.N), Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (REGN.O), and GlaxoSmithKline Plc (GSK.L)/Vir Biotechnology Inc (VIR.O). Such treatments can reduce hospitalizations and deaths by as much as 85% if used early in infected people, he said.The United States is battling another wave of cases due to the highly contagious Delta variant. Hospitalizations and deaths are also rising, particularly in Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and other parts of the U.S. South.The average number of deaths from COVID-19 has risen by 23% over the previous seven-day period, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, during a Tuesday press call. The United States is now averaging 1,000 COVID deaths a day and over 150,000 new cases, according to a Reuters tally.U.S. health officials have also noted the number of inoculations has also risen in recent weeks and say they hope Monday's FDA action spurs more people get their first shots.The U.S. military, along with several businesses and universities, including CVS Health Corp (CVS.N), privately held Deloitte and at least one college football team, have moved ahead with COVID vaccine mandates since the FDA's announcement, which also buoyed Wall Street.

2021-9-03,New kidney problems linked to \'long COVID\'; loss of smell may be followed by other smell distortions,https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSKBN2FZ1ES,"Sept 3 (Reuters) - The following is a summary of some recent studies on COVID-19. They include research that warrants further study to corroborate the findings and that have yet to be certified by peer review.'Long COVID' tied to higher kidney risksCOVID-19 symptoms that persist long after infection, known as ""long COVID"", has been tied to a higher risk for new kidney problems, according to a new study. Analyzing data on more than 1.7 million U.S. veterans, including nearly 90,000 COVID-19 survivors with symptoms lasting at least 30 days, researchers found the ""long haulers"" were at higher risk for new kidney problems compared to people who had not been infected with the coronavirus. This was true even when survivors had not been hospitalized, although declines in kidney function were ""more profound"" with more severe infection, they reported on Wednesday in the Journal of the American Society of Nephrology. Roughly 5% of the Long COVID group developed at least a 30% drop in a critical measure of kidney function known as the estimated glomerular filtration rate, or eGFR. Overall, people with long COVID were 25% more likely than uninfected people to develop a 30% decline in eGFR, with higher risks in survivors of more severe disease. While kidney function often declines with age, the damage in these patients ""was in excess"" of what happens with normal aging, study coauthor Dr. Ziyad Al-Aly, of Washington University in St. Louis, said in a statement. ""Our findings emphasize the critical importance of paying attention to kidney function and disease in caring for patients who have had COVID-19,"" he said.Loss of smell may be followed by smell distortionsMany people who lose their sense of smell due to COVID-19 eventually regain it, but some survivors later report smell distortions and unexplained smells, a new study found. Researchers analyzed survey responses from 1,468 individuals who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between April and September 2020 and had suffered loss of smell and taste at the start of their illness. Early on, about 10% also reported smell distortions, or parosmia, and unexplained smells, known as phantosmia. At an average of six to seven months after becoming ill and first reporting loss of smell, roughly 60% of women and 48% of men had regained less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability, and rates of smell distortions and imaginary smells had increased, the researchers reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Roughly 47% reported parosmia, saying, for example, ""some things now smell like chemicals."" About 25% reported phantosmia. ""Sometimes I can smell burning but no one else around me can,"" one respondent reported. Persistent smell problems were seen more often in survivors with more symptoms overall, ""suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID,"" the authors said.Vaccines induce antibodies despite cancer, immunocompromiseThe mRNA COVID-19 vaccines trigger protective immune responses in most cancer patients with solid tumors and in many people taking immunosuppressive medications, two small studies suggest. In Israel, researchers found that six months after the second dose of the vaccine from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech SE , 79% of 154 patients with solid tumors had developed antibodies, as had 84% of 135 similar people without cancer, a difference that was not deemed statistically significant. Antibody levels were similar in the two groups, the researchers reported on Thursday in Cancer Discovery. Separately, U.S. researchers studied 133 adults taking immunosuppressive medications for chronic inflammatory diseases and 53 healthy volunteers. At three weeks after the second shot of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), nearly 90% of the immunosuppressed participants had developed antibodies, although many had lower responses compared to the control group, according to a report published on Tuesday in Annals of Internal Medicine.Antibody therapy cuts hospitalization ratesPeople with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were treated with a monoclonal antibody ""cocktail"" had lower hospitalization rates than similar people who did not receive the treatment, researchers reported on Monday in EClinicalMedicine. They looked at nearly 1,400 such patients, roughly half of whom had received Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc's  combination monoclonal antibody therapy. Among those who received the treatment, about 45% were older than 65, and many had high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, lung disease and other risk factors. By four weeks after the treatment, 1.6% of them had been hospitalized, compared to 4.8% of patients not treated with the monoclonal antibodies. The study was not randomized and cannot prove the treatment caused the better outcomes. However, it ""suggests that when patients who are at high risk due to a range of comorbidities contract a mild or moderate case of COVID-19, this combination of monoclonal injections gives them a chance of a nonhospitalized recovery,"" study leader Dr. Raymund Razonable of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota in a statement.Click for a Reuters graphic on vaccines in development.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."

""Our findings emphasize the critical importance of paying attention to kidney function and disease in caring for patients who have had COVID-19,"" he said.Loss of smell may be followed by smell distortionsMany people who lose their sense of smell due to COVID-19 eventually regain it, but some survivors later report smell distortions and unexplained smells, a new study found. Researchers analyzed survey responses from 1,468 individuals who had been diagnosed with COVID-19 between April and September 2020 and had suffered loss of smell and taste at the start of their illness. Early on, about 10% also reported smell distortions, or parosmia, and unexplained smells, known as phantosmia. At an average of six to seven months after becoming ill and first reporting loss of smell, roughly 60% of women and 48% of men had regained less than 80% of their pre-illness smell ability, and rates of smell distortions and imaginary smells had increased, the researchers reported on Tuesday on medRxiv ahead of peer review. Roughly 47% reported parosmia, saying, for example, ""some things now smell like chemicals."" About 25% reported phantosmia. ""Sometimes I can smell burning but no one else around me can,"" one respondent reported. Persistent smell problems were seen more often in survivors with more symptoms overall, ""suggesting it may be a key marker of long-COVID,"" the authors said.Vaccines induce antibodies despite cancer, immunocompromiseThe mRNA COVID-19 vaccines trigger protective immune responses in most cancer patients with solid tumors and in many people taking immunosuppressive medications, two small studies suggest. In Israel, researchers found that six months after the second dose of the vaccine from Pfizer Inc (PFE.N) and BioNTech SE , 79% of 154 patients with solid tumors had developed antibodies, as had 84% of 135 similar people without cancer, a difference that was not deemed statistically significant. Antibody levels were similar in the two groups, the researchers reported on Thursday in Cancer Discovery. Separately, U.S. researchers studied 133 adults taking immunosuppressive medications for chronic inflammatory diseases and 53 healthy volunteers. At three weeks after the second shot of an mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna Inc (MRNA.O), nearly 90% of the immunosuppressed participants had developed antibodies, although many had lower responses compared to the control group, according to a report published on Tuesday in Annals of Internal Medicine.Antibody therapy cuts hospitalization ratesPeople with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who were treated with a monoclonal antibody ""cocktail"" had lower hospitalization rates than similar people who did not receive the treatment, researchers reported on Monday in EClinicalMedicine. They looked at nearly 1,400 such patients, roughly half of whom had received Regeneron Pharmaceutical Inc's  combination monoclonal antibody therapy. Among those who received the treatment, about 45% were older than 65, and many had high blood pressure, obesity, diabetes, lung disease and other risk factors. By four weeks after the treatment, 1.6% of them had been hospitalized, compared to 4.8% of patients not treated with the monoclonal antibodies. The study was not randomized and cannot prove the treatment caused the better outcomes. However, it ""suggests that when patients who are at high risk due to a range of comorbidities contract a mild or moderate case of COVID-19, this combination of monoclonal injections gives them a chance of a nonhospitalized recovery,"" study leader Dr. Raymund Razonable of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota in a statement.Click for a Reuters graphic on vaccines in development.Our Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles."
